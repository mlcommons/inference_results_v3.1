        "input": "Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond today held talks with Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman -\u00a0just hours before it was sensationally announced he had quit the BBC. The resignation  marks another blow for the hugely-popular show, which has been marred by uncertainty since Clarkson was axed  last month following a  'fracas' with a producer. It means Mr Wilman, a childhood friend of Clarkson who helped revamp Top Gear into the Corporation's most successful programme, is now free to reunite with the team on a rival channel. There is widespread speculation that the men are  working on a new motoring series to be aired by Netflix, Amazon or another British broadcaster - in what would be a nightmare scenario for the BBC. Scroll down for video . Back together: Jeremy Clarkson (left) is seen with his Top Gear colleagues James May (centre) and Richard Hammond (right) outside his  west London flat, in their first public appearance since he was sacked . Discussions: Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman (front centre) was also present at the meeting today, just hours before it was sensationally announced he had quit the BBC, in what is another blow for the show . Presenters: May had earlier said the BBC would be 'stupid' to try a version of the hit motoring show with 'a surrogate Jeremy', Richard Hammond and himself - adding that the idea was a \u2018non-starter\u2019 Something to smile about? The presenter looked in high spirits as he left the property with Mr Wilman. A BBC spokesman would not comment on the producer's resignation other than to confirm it . Put it there: Hammond and Clarkson shake hands as they part ways on a west London street . The men were photographed today outside Clarkson's home in west London - their first public appearance together since the presenter was dropped from Top Gear - before moving on to a pub. Earlier today, May ruled out returning to Top Gear without Clarkson, insisting it would be 'lame' with a new presenter in place of his sacked co-host. The 52-year-old said the BBC would be \u2018stupid\u2019 to try a version of the programme with 'a surrogate Jeremy', Hammond and himself - adding that the idea was a \u2018non-starter\u2019. His comments mean that if the show does return next year, it will likely be with an entirely new presenting team. Both May and Hammond saw their contracts finish last month. Casual: Speaking  today, May, pictured tonight, said he had just been 'having a pint' with his co-stars . May told\u00a0The Guardian: \u2018Me and Hammond with a surrogate Jeremy is a non-starter, it just wouldn\u2019t work. That would be lame, or \u201cawks\u201d as young people say. \u2018It has to be the three of us. You can\u2019t just put a surrogate Jeremy in and expect it to carry on. It would be forced. I don\u2019t believe they would be stupid enough to try that. \u2018It doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t go back - we may all go back in the future. It might just be we have a break from it. I don\u2019t know. It would be a bloody tough call to do Top Gear without Jeremy.\u2019 Former X Factor host Dermot O'Leary, model Jodie Kidd and Great British Bake Off host Sue Perkins have all been named as possible replacements for Clarkson. Speaking after the meeting today, May said he had just been 'having a pint' with his co-stars and Mr Wilman, adding that he still didn't know what he would do in the future. This evening, a BBC spokeswoman confirmed that Mr Wilman, Top Gear's longstanding executive producer and Clarkson's right-hand man, had handed  bosses his resignation. She would not say whether or not the decision was related to the outspoken presenter. It comes just weeks after an email from Mr Wilman to colleagues titled 'au revoir' was leaked. In the email, the 52-year-old, who has  made millions from the show,\u00a0congratulated staff on making 'one of the most iconic programmes in TV history'. 'At least we left 'em wanting more. And that alone, when you think about it, is quite an achievement for a show that started 13 years ago,' he wrote. After the email was leaked, Mr Wilman announced publicly that it had not been a resignation. The revelations today come after BBC2 boss Kim Shillinglaw, who has been tasked with finding a replacement for Clarkson on Top Gear, said the presenter \u2018will be back on the BBC\u2019 at some point. Leaving: Hammond arrived at the flat first, before May came in a BMW car - followed by Mr Wilman's arrival . Waving:\u00a0It comes a day after BBC2 boss Kim Shillinglaw, who has been tasked with finding a replacement for Clarkson (left) on Top Gear, said the 55-year-old presenter \u2018will be back on the BBC\u2019 at some point . Keeping mum: The group has not yet revealed whether it will work together on another car programme . Miss Shillinglaw also confirmed Clarkson's final Top Gear scenes will be screened later this year and she was not thinking of his replacement \u2018in terms of gender\u2019. Clarkson was sacked by the BBC after an \u2018unprovoked physical and verbal\u2019 attack in North Yorkshire that left his victim, Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon, in need of hospital treatment. The star was suspended last month when he became the subject of an internal BBC investigation after he attacked Mr Tymon, 36, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him. Clarkson's contract was not renewed, with director-general Tony Hall saying at the time 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'.

Victim: Clarkson was suspended last month when he became the subject of an internal BBC investigation after he attacked Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (pictured), 36, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him . Clarkson said he considered turning his back on presenting altogether in the immediate fall-out from the incident, but has since stated that he expects to present another TV show on cars in the future. Earlier this month, North Yorkshire Police said that following an investigation Clarkson would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel in Hawes. Meanwhile, Clarkson revealed in a newspaper column earlier this month that he was told by a doctor that he might have cancer, two days before assaulting Mr Tymon. Top Gear - which is said to generate about \u00a350million a year for BBC Worldwide - is viewed by more than six million viewers on BBC2 and watched in more than 200 countries. DERMOT O'LEARY\u00a0(6/4) Bookmakers\u2019 favourite O'Leary, 41, is currently being lined up to host a different prime-time BBC One motoring show - after ending his eight-year stint as host of ITV's The X Factor last month.

        "input": "The 19-year-old, named locally as Moses Yitzchok Greenfeld (above) from Stamford hill, London, was pulled from the water in Hampstead Heath, north London, after getting into difficulty while swimming . Police officers 'watched' as a group of teenagers desperately tried to save their friend who drowned in Hampstead Heath pond, it has been claimed. Moses Yitzchok Greenfeld, 19, from Stamford Hill, London, had been swimming with four friends as temperatures reached 25C when he got into difficulty. An eyewitness has said at least seven police officers stood on a bank and watched as the boys dived in and out looking for their friend. The teenagers were reportedly heard shouting to ambulance crews on the side, asking how long someone could survive under water as they scrambled around trying to save their friend. It is thought Mr Greenfield may have had a cardiac arrest because of the shock of jumping into the cold water. His body was eventually discovered five foot below the surface and 20ft from the water's edge just before 11pm on Wednesday - nearly six hours after he was reported in trouble at 5.30pm. James Eisen, a 43-year-old freelance journalist, said: 'I was walking past and I could see a lot of commotion going on over the far side of the pond. 'The guy's friends were going in and out of the water and holding their breath and diving under frantically. 'There were police officers and paramedics and firefighters on the bank just standing there watching while the boys dived under. There was at least seven police officers on the side. 'It was a chaotic and surreal scene. 'I heard one of the boys shouting to one of the ambulance crews and asking how long someone could survive under water without breathing as they continued swimming around in a panic. 'I'm guessing the emergency services are told not to go into the water but if that's the case they probably shouldn't have let the boys carry on swimming about. 'Before I left the police helicopter was flying over and they had launched some boats onto the pond.' Mr Grunfeld's family have paid tribute to the teenager, who they described as a 'wonderful' and 'friendly' man, but said there was no blame because they believed that was the way God was meant to 'take him.' Mr Greenfeld, who is from the Orthodox Jewish community and is thought to have lost his Rabbi father to cancer five years ago, had recently flown home to London from New York, where he was studying religion at a Jewish college. Tragically, he only returned the UK to be with his family during the Passover holiday. His sister, who asked not be named, said: 'He was a wonderful young man and lovely brother who was very well liked, friendly, and he will be dearly missed by his family and friends. 'He was very into studies but he was very fun to be with and he would always try to lend a hand.\u201d Police, specialist divers and 30 firefighters scoured the water for the missing teenager and his body was found five foot below the surface just before 11pm last night. He got into difficulty while swimming with four friends . 'We believe that whatever God does is for the good, so if that\u2019s the way he [God] was meant to take him [Moses] then it must be good for him and for us, because it was meant to be. 'So there\u2019s no blame, no pointing, because what was meant to happen, happened, and there was nothing anybody could have done to avoid it.' Speaking of the police response she added: 'Of course we would have liked it if they could have got their quicker. But we really appreciate what the police have done and they treated us and our religious beliefs with respect. 'They waited for Jewish men to come [to the pond] to handle the body, and we really appreciate that.' The group had been swimming outside of the designated area and out of hours at a time when no lifeguards were on duty, it was claimed. Members of his family gathered at the edge of the large pond \u2013 which had been packed in the day with sunbathers \u2013 as specialist divers from the Marine Policing Unit\u00a0and around 30 firefighters scoured the water for him. Emergency services workers could be seen taking a stretcher into the park after the discovery of the body . The tragedy came on the hottest day of the year so far as temperatures reached 25.1C at St James's Park in the capital and in Frittenden, Kent. It is believed Mr Greenfeld may have suffered a heart attack brought on by the sudden change in body temperature after diving into the chilly 8C  pond, the\u00a0Evening Standard reported. A friend of Mr Greenfeld told the newspaper: 'He arrived with pals after driving up from Hackney. They got here after 5pm and the lifeguard was not on duty. 'I think Moses got into difficulty in the shallow part of the pond but there's a steep drop-off. They recovered his clothes from the side of the pond. 'His mother is devastated. He lost his father to cancer when he was young.' The boys had entered the water after the 4.30pm closure wearing what Mr Eisen described as boxers or swimming shorts. He was seen scrambling in a 10ft deep section of the pond and shouting for help before he disappeared under the surface. Emergency services were called just after 5.30pm and a subsequent search involved 30 firefighters, a police marine unit and a police helicopter. The young man's body was eventually pulled out at about 11pm after extensive searches of the murky water. The heath is controlled by the Corporation of London and a spokesman said that officers had not entered the water to try and save the drowning teenager. Last night, members of Mr Grenfeld's family gathered at the edge of the large pond \u2013 which had been packed in the day with sunbathers \u2013 as specialist police divers and around 30 firefighters scoured the water for him . Members of the\u00a0Hatzola team, a group which provides 24/7 emergency care and ambulance services in London, were also called to the scene, along with a police helicopter, specialist divers and about 30 firefighters . A spokesman said: 'The heath constabulary officers are here to enforce bylaws in the park, they are not trained lifeguards and the water is dangerous and very murky, so they are advised they are not to go in until proper assistance arrives. 'He was swimming away from the designated area and out of hours so there were no lifeguards on duty. 'There are signs everywhere warning people not to go into the water at these times. 'Visibility in the water is about six inches, it's very murky, and you can barely see in front of your face. 'He had swum out over a ten foot drop and was about 20 feet from the side when he experienced difficulty - you have to be a strong swimmer to be out there. 'It is a complete tragedy but these are the facts behind it.' The Metropolitan Police confirmed a report was now being prepared for the coroner. The heath was full of sunbathers as the incident unfolded yesterday, as dozens of people had gathered to enjoy the unseasonably warm weather. One man, who claimed to be Mr Grenfeld's uncle, said the teenager had gone swimming with friends. He said: 'He went swimming and he must have struggled and he cannot be found. It's very tragic. They did the surface search and they called it off. The divers are coming in. That will change it from a rescue to a recovery.' Henna Anaya, who was on the heath with her son at the time of the incident, said: 'There were about four friends, all of them in the water, and they were swimming. I told my son they were just messing around. 'The next minute someone said to me he was going down and waving his arm and telling his friend to help, he was sinking. There were guys jumping in to help. The guy who went in told me that police had asked him to get out of the water.' Specialist police divers and around 30 firefighters joined the search for a 19-year-old man who got into difficulty while swimming in\u00a0Hampstead Ponds in Hampstead Heath, north London, yesterday afternoon . Police were initially called to the scene just after 5.30pm after receiving reports from concerned members of the public that a teenager was in difficulty and under the water. His body was retrieved fromt the lake at 11pm . Another witness, who didn't wish to be named, said: 'It was right at the other end from where the lifeguard would have been, so by the time he was struggling, it would've already been too late. 'One woman said she heard the boys shouting for help, but only realised afterwards because at the time she couldn't understand what they were saying. 'The emergency services arrived very quickly, but you can't make miracles. It's just a tragedy.' Andrew Dutton-Parish, a regular swimmer at the Men's Pond who was also at the heath, added: 'It's such a sad start to the summer. It's very rare for anyone to be drowned.' A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said paramedics arrived on the scene within eight minutes, but the emergency teams, accompanied by a police helicopter, were unable to save the young man. The teenager is the second person to have died while swimming on the heath in the past two years. In August 2013, photographer Sussie Ahlburg, 51, from Holborn, drowned in the ladies' bathing pond. It later emerged she had a heart condition and had been warned not to swim in 'open water' by a cardiologist. Hampstead Heath has three swimming ponds which can become extremely busy in good weather. Despite temperatures reaching 25C in London yesterday, waters remained cool on the heath, with temperatures recorded at about 8C. Hampstead Ponds in Hampstead Heath, north London (pictured), is a popular spot for residents and tourists .",

        "input": "An investigation has concluded Freddie Gray broke his neck after falling head-first into the back of the police van as it was moving, it was reported today. Medical and law enforcement sources briefed on the police investigation told ABC News Gray's 'catastrophic' head injuries were consistent with hitting a bolt 'in the back door of the van'. They claimed there was 'no evidence' Gray sustained a fatal spine injury during his arrest, which was caught on camera on a street side on April 12. According to ABC's sources, Gray was standing in the van, bent over with his hand cuffed behind his back and his head pointing towards the back door. It is believed he fell into the door, breaking his neck. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A report claims Freddie Gray broke his neck when he fell head-first into the back of the van as it was moving . Similar van: Freddie Gray was stood, bent over, with his head facing the back door of a van like this . Timeline? It is believed Gray fell head-first into the back of the van, breaking his neck, during the journey . Inside: The above diagram shows the inside the police van . Pictured: The second stop which police failed to report in their paperwork after the van journey, during which Freddie Gray sustained a 'catastrophic' head injury. It was picked up by a privately-owned security camera . According to the latest police press conference, these are the stops the van made transporting Freddie Gray . The news comes hours after Baltimore Police admitted the van transporting Gray made a previously unreported stop. The mysterious detail was picked up by a privately-owned security camera, and will be integral to the police investigation into Gray's death, which was completed and handed to the state prosecutor on Thursday morning. It is not known why the van stopped at the corner of North Fremont Ave and Mosher Street before it made another two stops then finally transported Gray to the hospital. And police have yet to clarify why Gray would have been standing without a seat belt on. Just nine days before his arrest, the Baltimore Police Department issued a new policy, making it obligatory to belt all inmates placed in the back of a transport van. Revelation: Police Commissioner Anthony Batts revealed a private security camera captured the van making an unknown stop. He refused to elaborate on the details of the new information . Police Commissioner Anthony Batts refused to elaborate on the new information. He said the contents of the report, which was completed and handed to the State Attorney at 8.50am Thursday, will remain confidential as they continue to investigate. Six officers have been suspended with pay over the incident, and the department has admitted Gray - who was asthmatic - should have been given the medical help he requested. The report that Gray fell inside the van corroborates claims he was given a 'rough ride' by the van driver, who is the only officer yet to deliver a statement to the investigators, according to ABC. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton. As the police department, Mayor's office, and state prosecutors refuse to address the development, it has done nothing but fuel anger and speculation surrounding the circumstances of Gray's arrest more than two weeks ago. A relative of one of the suspended police officers told CNN she believes Gray was injured during his arrest outside the van. Her family member, she said, was based inside the van, and she fears he will be made a scapegoat for something he 'didn't do'. However, this theory is at odds with the medical examiner's report which allegedly found Gray sustained injuries by falling over inside the van, where he had been placed without a seat belt. The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN her family member was in the van with Gray as he screamed and cried for medical help. But she believes the spinal injury which led to Gray's death was inflicted earlier, during his arrest on April 12. In an appeal that echoes Gray's family, she is calling for the police department to conduct a thorough investigation that will determine which of the six suspended police officers dealt the fatal blow. 'Six officers did not injure this man,' she told Don Lemon. Secret stop: This is the corner where the police van was spotted making a previously unreported stop . These are the security cameras outside a grocery which picked up the secret stop . Jung Hwang's convenience store's camera footage revealed a new stop the police van made while transporting Freddie Gray . 'Six officers didn't put him in the hospital. 'I'm worried that instead of them figuring out who did, that six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie Gray.' Her words came after a police document was leaked to the\u00a0Washington Post, in which the other prisoner in the transport van with Gray said he could hear the 25-year-old slamming himself against the wall. The prisoner speculated that Gray was trying to hurt himself. In the documents, the unidentified prisoner says he was loaded into a police van after Gray on April 12, and apparently told investigators that he heard Gray 'banging against the walls' and 'intentionally trying to injure himself'. However, he admits he could not see what Gray was doing, since they were separated by a metal partition. The statement was cited in a warrant to search an arresting officer's clothing for possible traces of Gray's DNA. The van in which Gray was injured is a Chevrolet Express - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the 'Scooby' van driven by Hillary Clinton . The assertion that Gray may have caused his own death in the back of the police van was quickly rejected by an attorney hired by his family. 'We disagree with any implication that Freddie Gray severed his own spinal cord,' attorney Jason Downs told the Post. 'We question the accuracy of the police reports we've seen thus far, including the police report that says Mr Gray was arrested without force or incident.' Outrage over the unexplained death of a black man in Baltimore, Maryland prompted nationwide protests against police brutality on Wednesday from Houston to Boston. Baltimore has been the scene of near-nightly protests ever since the April 19 death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, who is believed to have been fatally injured while in police custody. State Attorney Marilyn Mosby urged the public to be patient as she reviews the information. 'While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,' Mosby said on Thursday. 'We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.' Freddie Gray: The 25-year-old was poisoned by lead paint as a child growing up in Baltimore . Freddie Gray was a 25-year-old African-American who grew up in Baltimore's impoverished west side . Nicknamed 'Pepper', he was described by an ex-girlfriend as happy-go-lucky with an infectious sense of humor. The Baltimore police knew him, however, as a 5ft-8ins felon who had notched up at least 18 arrests and a handful of convictions - mainly for Class A drugs but also burglary, assault and illegal gambling. He was said to have set off running at the sight of police patrolling a well known open-air drug market. He was taken into custody for possession of a switchblade and during transport to the station he experienced what officers described as 'a medical emergency'. Gray, who had asthma, requested an inhaler and had trouble breathing in the van, but police didn't provide his inhaler. According to Gray's family his spine was severed 80 per cent at his neck, three vertebrae were fractured and his larynx was injured. Court papers describe Gray's childhood as problematic. He lived with his heroin-addicted disabled mother in a home in Sandtown-Winchester that contained enough poisonous lead in the peeling painted walls and windowsills for a court settlement to conclude that he and his two sisters were incapable of leading normal functioning lives. Lab tests conducted in the 1990s showed that they had levels of lead in their blood nearly double what the state of Maryland defines as the minimum for lead poisoning. In Baltimore, more than 2,600 children have been found to have high levels of lead in their blood, according an annual report released by the Maryland Department of the Environment in 2014. 'This is the toxic legacy of lead-based paint,\u201d Ruth Ann Norton, head of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative and a founding member of the Maryland Lead Poisoning Prevention Commission, told the Baltimore Sun. 'Our kids are ill equipped to stay in the classroom, finish school. They\u2019re very unlikely to go on to higher education. They\u2019re less likely to be able to hold a job', she said. 'They\u2019re less equipped to be able to overcome the poverty and other circumstances that pull them down. Children with lead poisoning will have defects, regardless of whether their parents are \u2018nice\u2019 or not.' Gray lived off the resulting 'lead check' settlement although it is unclear exactly how much he received. Whatever money he did have he was said to spend buying designer accessories. The Sandtown neighborhood is a 72-block neighborhood made up of almost entirely of African Americans. More than one-third of residents live below the poverty line, and nearly a quarter are unemployed. The majority of Maryland's state prison population are said to said to hail from Sandtown, according to the Justice Policy Institute.",

        "input": "The Tories have accused Labour of a crude new attempt to 'weaponise' the NHS by orchestrating a letter from doctors claiming hospitals will not be safe if David Cameron wins the election. Ed Miliband was also accused of hypocrisy after he claimed that the Coalition had made it harder to get a GP appointment. Mr Miliband claimed there were now 600 fewer GP surgeries open during evenings and weekends than before the previous election \u2013 which he said was directly contributing to the A&E crisis. Scroll down for video . Labour launched a poster declaring 'the Tories have made it harder to see a GP' but critics were quick to point out that the figures were out of date . His comments came after Labour launched a poster declaring 'the Tories have made it harder to see a GP'. But critics were quick to point out that his figures were out of date \u2013 and that the GP crisis is widely blamed on Labour's GP contracts, which allowed them to opt out of out-of-hours care. Meanwhile it emerged last night that a Labour-supporting GP had circulated a letter claiming that 'five years of flat-line funding' have 'crippled the NHS'. A version of the letter \u2013 organised by Dr Clare Gerada, the former chairman of the Royal College of GPs \u2013 appeared in the Guardian signed by more than 100 doctors last night. It claimed the 'direction of travel' under the Tories was towards privatisation, adding: 'Another five years of Tory austerity will sap staff morale and reduce the NHS to a poor service for poor people'. Labour were accused of orchestrating the letter as a 'stitch up'. Conservative MP Julian Smith said: 'This Labour stitch up is another desperate attempt to weaponise the NHS. 'Under this government, we've got more doctors, more nurses and more patients being seen than ever before.' In an email obtained by the Tories, Dr Gerada said signatures were being collected to 'counter' the 100 business leaders who wrote a Tory-supporting letter to a national paper last week. Mr Miliband claimed there were now 600 fewer GP surgeries open during evenings and weekends than before the previous election \u2013 which he said was directly contributing to the A&E crisis . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has promised to give NHS chiefs 'whatever they need' after the election. Mr Hunt yesterday claimed a Conservative government would find whatever money the health service said was required to cope with the growing pressure on hospitals and GP surgeries. The apparently open-ended commitment will raise eyebrows at a time when public spending is under increasing pressure. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens has said the health service needs an extra \u00a38billion a year by 2020 just to keep standards as they are. The Tories have pledged to find huge public spending cuts, and every pound spent on the NHS means less for other priorities such as education and defence. Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'We will back the NHS's own plan in full ... We will give whatever they need, it might be more than \u00a38billion, it might be less.' Dr Gerada said she was a member of the Labour party but not an 'activist' and said the letter had been organised independently. She told the Telegraph: 'It has not been orchestrated by Labour, it has been put together by me and a few other medical leaders.' The Tories say that at least two of the signatories are Labour supporters, including one who tried to stand as a Labour candidate and another who has previously spoken at the Labour Party conference. The signatories, including Professor John Ashton, retired director of public health, and Simon Capewell, professor of public health in Liverpool, wrote that the NHS 'is withering away'. They said 'if things carry on as they are then in future people will be denied care they once had under the NHS and have to pay more for health services.' Meanwhile, as figures yesterday revealed that A&E waiting times are the longest since records began in 2004/05, Mr Miliband said: 'One of the reasons for that is it's got a lot harder to see a GP. 'Across England there are some 600 fewer GP surgeries open in the evenings and at weekends than there were at the last general election.' But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Labour's 'shoddy figures are not only wrong but also expose Labour's rank hypocrisy over GP access'. Mr Hunt said the figures quoted only go up to 2013/14 and that since then, the Conservatives' extended hours scheme, announced last year, has covered 1,100 practices and helped 7.5million patients see GPs in the evenings and at weekends. He said by next year the scheme will cover 1,400 additional practices, serving 10 million more people. He added: 'The next Conservative Government will deliver a truly seven-day NHS, putting right a problem which began with Labour's disastrous 2004 GP contract.' Mr Hunt said the contract had allowed GPs to opt out of responsibility for their patients out of hours. He added that far from cutting funding, the Tories would give the NHS 'whatever it needs' if the party wins the election. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg accused Labour of 'making cheap political points using outdated statistics'. 'It's pretty rich coming from a party that blew \u00a312billion on an NHS super computer,' he said. Mr Clegg also described shadow health secretary Andy Burnham as 'a slightly sort of cardboard cut out, a rather sort of silly Labour politician.' Medical leaders also criticised Labour's claims yesterday. GP Mike Dixon, chairman of the NHS Alliance, said: 'Labour's poster is not fair. 'Patient access to extended hour services hasn't got worse, as these figures ignore the Prime Minister's new scheme.' Chris Leslie, shadow Treasury minister, said the figures were the latest available. Following the letter from 100 doctors claiming the NHS is not safe in Tory hands, Labour is today expected to launch a fresh attack over the health service. JAMES SLACK sifts the claims from the reality. CLAIM:\u00a0There are 590 fewer GP surgeries open at evenings and weekends compared to Labour's last year in office . REALITY: Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham is using figures which compare July 2009 to the year ending April 2014 - which means they are a full year out of date. This year is crucial in comparing the record of the last two governments. In April 2014, David Cameron launched his \u00a350million Challenge Fund to pay for GPs to open out-ofhours. It guaranteed at least one GP surgery locally would be available in the evening and weekends. The Tories say it has led to improved access for 7.5million people at 1,100 surgeries. By March next year, a further \u00a3100million will have been spent on a further 1,417 practices across the country. Overall, there are now 1,600 more GPs than in 2010. It is not the first time Labour has used old figures in what is already a dishonest election campaign. The party's claim that families are \u00a31,600 worse off under the Tories was also 12 months past its sell-by date. CLAIM: The Tories have made it harder to see a GP . REALITY: Anybody with memory of the Blair Years will know it is Labour - and the disastrous 2004 decision to renegotiate the existing GP contract - which lies at the root of the current problems. Not only did Labour abolish the requirement for every patient to have a named GP who was responsible for them, instead attaching them only to a surgery, but, most crucially, GPs were given more money despite no longer being required to work at weekends or at night. The inevitable result? Nine out often GPs stopped providing out-ofhours care - hugely increasing the pressure on hospital A&E departments. Former health Minister Mike O'Brien said the deal Labour gave to the GPs was 'the best they ever had... they probably all voted Labour in 2005'.\u00a0Tory health secretary Jeremy Hunt has since made modest changes to the contract, such as giving four million over-75s a named GP, but there is still no requirement to work out- of-hours. CLAIM: The Tories have left the NHS weaker than at any stage in its history . REALITY: In the latest attempt by Labour and the Left to 'weaponise' the NHS, 100 doctors last night released a letter which claimed the NHS was 'withering away' under the Coalition and 'if things carry on as they are then in future people will be denied care they once had'. It went on: Privatisation not only threatens coordinated services but also jeopardises training of our future health care providers and medical research, particularly that of public health.' The problem is that much of the letter is at odds with the facts. Along with foreign aid, spending on the health service was ring-fenced from the cuts. Every year, it has received a real terms increase of at least 0.1 per cent. This equates to around \u00a32.5billion extra a year. On privatisation, the NHS outsourced 4.4 per cent of its budget under the Labour party - but less than 2 per cent under the Coalition. It was Labour - not the Tories - which presided over the shameful scandals at Basildon and Mid Staffs hospitals which cost hundreds of lives.",

His final request comes as images from Nusakambangan showed a haunting self portrait painted by Sukumaran in his cell, depicting the artist shot through the heart. His brother, Chinthu Sukumaran has pleaded with the Indonesian president to call off the firing squad while Sukumaran's lawyer was pictured removing the morbid paintings from the death row inmate's cell. Sukumaran's fellow death row inmate, Andrew Chan, has requested to spend his last hours in church with his family. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran has requested to spend his final days painting. He painted this self-portrait, showing a bullet through his heart . The painting is a self-portrait of Sukumaran with a bullet hole through his heart . It comes after it was confirmed that Australians Andrew Chan and Sukumaran will be executed just after the stroke of midnight on Wednesday (3am AEST). The date - April 29 - became official when a local funeral director in Cilacap, the nearest port to Nusakambangan, or Death Island, was instructed to inscribe the names of those to be shot by firing squad and the date of their deaths. Sukumaran only began painting when he was arrested and sent to prison in 2005. His skill and love for his art grew as he was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty - who has also led the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives.

Julian McMahon (pictured) the lawyer for the Bali Nine pair, removed the morbid paintings from Sukumaran's cell . McMahon looked downcast as he carried the paintings back from Death Island . Painting has proven a great sense of solace for Sukumaran during his time in jail and has even run art classes for fellow inmates as part of the drug rehabilitation program that he set up with Chan. The talented artist's birthday in early April was marked in London where his cousin organised an exhibition of his paintings at the Amnesty International headquarters. The Bali Nine pair's lawyer Julian McMahon took four disturbing self portrait from Sukumaran's cell on Sunday, depicting the artist shot through the heart. The paintings were signed: 'Our new prison.

A smiling Djoko Hariutomo, the police commissioner of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, poses for a photo with his hand on the shoulder of condemned prisoner Andrew Chan on a plane taking him to 'Death Island' They were dated April 24 and April 25. Chan and Sukumaran both refused to sign their execution warrants during official proceedings on Saturday, saying they believed it would be unjust to kill them. Chan and Sukumaran, convicted in 2005 for their role in a plot to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia, were given the official 72 hours notice on Saturday. 'He's found peace with what may happen but he and we all feel that this is a grave injustice and it did not have to be this way and it still doesn't have to be this way,'\u00a0Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters, after spending a couple of hours with his brother. Surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return, 33-year-old Australia Myuran Sukumaran looks up at Bali police commissioner Djoko Hariutomo who posed with the two condemned Australians before they were transported to\u00a0Nusakambangan island . It has been confirmed that the two men will be executed just past midnight on Wednesday . His mother Raji and sister Brintha also visited on Sunday, making the sad journey with Chan's mother Helen, brother Michael and fianc\u00e9e Feby Herewila and other friends. Chinthu Sukumaran said they asked Joko Widodo to show the same mercy he'd asked for his own citizens on death row overseas. 'Please, please show mercy,' he said. 'There are nine people with families that love them. Sukumaran painted the portraits in the hours before he and Andrew Chan were given execution notices . 'That's mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, brothers and sisters. 'We ask the president to please use his powers to intervene and save their lives.' Mr Chan said his brother's only wish would be to go to church with his family in his last days. 'The two boys are still holding up pretty well considering they feel this is injust (unjust) to what has happened over the last ten years with their whole case,' he said. 'Somewhere in the legal system for Indonesia there's got to be mercy and the president needs to show that now. 'He's the only one that can stop it and it's not too late to do so.' It's reported only nine of the 10 prisoners Indonesia had readied for execution will face the firing squad, with Frenchman Serge Atlaoui granted a reprieve. Mr Atlaoui apparently won a reprieve based on an administrative matter. Mr McMahon carried Sukumaran's self-portraits away after showing them to reporters . The back of Sukumaran's morbid paintings read: 'self portrait' 72hrs just started' The paintings were signed by Sukumaran and dated . Sukumaran and Chan have been granted more time with family in their final days and will see them again on Monday. Lawyers are pleading with Jakarta to respect legal proceedings that several are still pursuing, while international pressure for mercy also grows. France has pledged to work with Australia to halt the executions, with Prime Minister Tony Abbott set to meet Francois Hollande on Monday. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been seeking urgent talks with her Indonesian counterpart since Friday. Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers have lodged a challenge with the constitutional court but the attorney-general doesn't acknowledge it, arguing the pair have exhausted their appeals.

But his office is yet to respond to moves by lawyers for Filipina Mary Jane Veloso, who filed a second request for a judicial review late on Friday. Indonesia Zainal Abidin has an appeal before the courts due to be decided on Monday, but has been moved in preparation of execution as if the result is pre-determined. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has added his voice to global calls for Indonesia to halt its execution plans. 'The Secretary General urges President Joko Widodo to urgently consider declaring a moratorium on capital punishment in Indonesia, with a view toward abolition,' a spokesman for Ban said. Last ditch efforts to save the pair have also been launched by not-for-profit organisations, such as Amnesty International. His work was showcased at an exhibition in London on his birthday .

Amnesty International says the floral message will be displayed from Monday at Blues Point Reserve. 'Today in Indonesia, up to nine people - including Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran - face imminent execution in as little as 72 hours,' Amnesty said in a statement. 'More than 140 countries around the world have now abolished the death penalty for good. It's not too late for Indonesia to join them.'

        "input": "Archaeologists  have uncovered a ritual burial of 2,000-year-old human skulls - sparking the theory they could be the remains of Boudicca's rebels - as the London Crossrail excavations continue. The latest discovery of cremated human bones packed neatly into a cooking pot and set off at the side of the historic River Walbrook, in London, has experts questioning whether they were part of a gruesome ceremony. When about 20 skulls were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary in 2013 it had been thought that they had got there down stream after being eroded out of a Roman cemetery to the north - but new evidence suggests otherwise. Scroll down for video . New find: Around seven human skulls (pictured) dating back nearly 2,000 years have so far been found as part of the latest discovery by archaeologists at the London Crossrail site near Liverpool Street station . Roman rummaging: One of the skulls (left) was uncovered next to a Roman road which has also been found. A piece of Roman figurative pottery (right) was also dug up during searches of the site . Digging for history: A cross-section of the Roman roadside ditch uncovered at Liverpool Street station . The estimated age of the human remains and the way they appear to have been disposed of has led to the suggestion that the bones could even be Boudicca's rebels. Scientific tests are continuing on the cremated remains, with the possibility the grim ritual theory may be confirmed and that most of the seven skulls found so far are heads of  executed criminals and rebels. A spokesman for London Crossrail confirmed the team was working up a number of theories. He said: 'We don't have any answers yet but we are looking into it.' The Boudiccan Revolt raged from 60-61AD and saw British tribes, under Boudicca of the Iceni, unsuccessfully try to defeat the Roman army. Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who lived in what is today Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. The revolt resulted in Camulodunum, now Colchester, London, and Verulamium, now St Albans, being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives.

'No answers': Archaeologists have uncovered a ritual burial of 2,000-year-old human skulls - sparking the theory they could be the remains of Boudicca's rebels. The bones are to be sent away for further analysis . A long needle believed to be from the Roman period was also dug up. It will now undergo scientific tests . Revolt: Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who tried to defeat the Roman army . The Boudiccan Revolt raged from 60-61AD and saw British tribes, under Boudicca of the Iceni, unsuccessfully try to defeat the Roman army. Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who lived in what is today Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. Her name is an early for of the more commonly known name 'Victoria'. Her husband, Prasutagus, was ruler of the Iceni people, and the Romans allowed Prasutagus to continue as king, ruling on their behalf. But, when Prasutagus died, the Romans decided to rule the Iceni directly and they confiscated the property of the leading Iceni families. The Romans are also said to have stripped and whipped Boudicca, and raped her daughters. The revolt resulted in Camulodunum, now Colchester, London, and Verulamium, now St Albans, being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives. Colchester was the first target of the Boudiccan army and many of the townspeople were rounded up and sacrificed in nearby groves. The Crossrail team spokesman said a connection was not currently being made between the skulls from 2,000 years ago and Boudicca's rebels but the possibility has not been ruled out. Work to excavate 3,000 skeletons from Bedlam burial ground, at the site of the new Liverpool Street station that will serve the cross-London rail network, has now been completed. It took a team of 60 archaeologists four weeks, working six days a week, to remove the remains and record evidence for what may prove to be, in archaeological terms, London's most valuable 16th and 17th Century cemetery site. Among the skeletons discovered at the burial site - used from 1569 until at least 1738, including the Great Plague in 1665 - were a mother a her child buried side-by-side. They have now been transferred to the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA). It took a team of 60 archaeologists four weeks, working six days a week, to remove the 3,000 skeletons previously found in the Bedlam burial ground, at the site of the new Liverpool Street station . Scientific tests are continuing on the cremated remains, with the possibility the grim ritual theory may be confirmed and that most of the seven skulls found so far are heads of executed criminals and rebels .

A close-up look of the Roman needle found as part of the archaeological digs . A decoration thought to be from the Tudor period was among the historic finds near Liverpool Street station . Crossrail workers are in the process of building a new ticket hall above the burial site - also known as Bethlehem and the New Churchyard - which was opened after graveyards around London started to overflow. It was used to bury London\u2019s poor and religious non-conformists as well as patients from Bethlem Royal Hospital - the first dedicated psychiatric institution in Europe. Workers are now digging through medieval marsh deposits and Roman remains including a road that runs under the site.\u00a0Archaeologists are expected to finish on site in September, after which construction will proceed on a new eastern ticket hall. Speaking last month, Jay Carver, Crossrail lead archaeologist, said: 'This excavation presents a unique opportunity to understand the lives and deaths of 16th and 17th century Londoners.

Crossrail workers are in the process of building a new ticket hall above the burial site - also known as Bethlehem and the New Churchyard - which was opened after graveyards around London started to overflow . 'The Bedlam burial ground spans a fascinating phase of London's history, including the transition from the Tudor-period city into cosmopolitan early-modern London. 'This is probably the first time a sample of this size from this time period has been available for archaeologists to study in London. 'Bedlam was used by a hugely diverse population from right across the social spectrum and from different areas of the city.' The Museum of London Archaeology is undertaking the archaeological excavations at Liverpool Street  on behalf of Crossrail. Scientific analysis of the remains will help provide new insights into the lives and deaths of early modern Londoners. So far, Crossrail has found more than 10,000 artefacts spanning many years of London's past across more than 40 construction sites. It is the UK's largest archaeology project. In 2013 and 2014, preliminary excavations at the Liverpool Street site in 2013 and 2014  uncovered more than 400 skeletons and numerous artefacts. The Crossrail project has already unearthed a number of exciting discoveries, including more than 10,000\u00a0artefacts at more than 40 construction sites. In 2013, workers made an 'unexpected and fascinating discovery' in tunnels underneath\u00a0Liverpool Street Station, where the historic River Walbrook flows. The Crossrail team unearthed about 20 Roman skulls which were\u00a0found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary. The Crossrail team unearthed Roman skulls in 2013, which had been buried in clusters at Bedlam . Working under the direction of archaeologists, the construction workers carefully removed the human skulls, as well as a collection of ancient Roman pottery. For safety reasons the archaeologists had to leave the work to the tunnellers as the skulls were buried as deep as six metres below ground. The discovery of the skulls and pottery was made below the site of the historic Bedlam burial ground. Bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century. Historically, Roman skulls have been found along the Thames tributary Walbrook during various excavations in the region. Prior to the discovery of the Roman skulls, workers also found about 4,000 skeletons buried in the Eldon Street area. These skeletons were found in August 2013 and were carefully removed during major archaeological excavations last year .",

In a tense interview for 60 Minutes, Silva visits the home of James Polkinghorne's father to explain to him why she had to kill his son. Michael Usher, the veteran journalist who conducted the interview, has revealed her walked away from the experience 'totally drained and realising that there are a lot of broken people'. He also admitted that despite all the revelations about his son's abusive ways, Mr Polkinghorne could still not understand why his son was dead. Scroll down for video . Jessica Silva reveals on 60 Minutes that 'my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness' Jessica Silva tells 60 Minutes that if she hadn't stabbed Polkinghorne 'I would have been dead' On Sunday night, Jessica Silva speaks publicly for the first time about the day, Mother\u2019s Day 2012, when she stabbed and killed her partner, the father of her young son. Last month she walked free from court, despite being convicted of manslaughter, free to tell of the four years of horror and warning other women not to make the same mistakes. 'That was a very tense meeting (with the father), very nervous, both sides very nervous,' Michael Usher told Daily Mail Australia. 'His family, his father, has had to deal with a lot of anger and hatred. 'He doesn't understand why she had to kill his son, it's only the start of a process, there is no neat ending at all. Grace and Avalino Silva (Jessica\u2019s parents). He revealed to Michael Usher that the ordeal had so destroyed Jessica that 'I looked into my daughter's eyes and I didn't recognise her' Jessica Silva admits she was living in fear and violence and she told no one. 'When her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said \"it was just a rash\", it's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear' 'During the interview she gets to the point where she reveals \"my head is just full, I can't live with it, I need forgiveness\". 'I don't know if there will ever be a neat ending. 'Although the violence has stopped, the mental torment is still there, the absolute anguish of having killed the feather of her son, dealing with the family disconnect with her and their grandson, tragic. 'This one person and all of his anger and violence, the impact that he's had it's extraordinary, a lot of broken people who only just now are thinking about a future. 'The thing that made me stop was when she begins recalling the domestic violence she was suffering, it was one of those moments where it was so difficult to put yourself in her shoes. 'It had all the horrible hallmarks, \"you're fat, you're ugly\", the belittling of her. 'And then how, this was a big guy, more than 100 kilos of muscle who would pick her up by one hand and throw her across the room. 'She was living in fear and violence and she told no one, when her mum saw the red marks on her heck she said \"it was just a rash\". 'It's brutal and as bad a domestic violence as you could hear, living in fear then and that she would be going to jail for a very long time.' Jessica tells her tragic tale of survival for the first time on 60 Minutes this Sunday night, a victim of the worst type of domestic abuse, suffering years of verbal and physical attacks by her partner, James Polkinghorne. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way, she deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that' Michael Usher said of the Jessica Silva interview . Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times, after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice', the trial judge heard . 'On that fateful night, Jessica made a split-second decision to save herself and her family,' according to the 60 Minutes program. 'Jessica opens up about her life with Polkinghorne and recounts what happened the night that ended in his death.' 'I didn't realise that she was going to be as raw as she still was,' Usher added. 'It is the first time she has spoken about it, aside from the police interview, about what happened that night and how she came to be arrested and charged with murder. 'She tells it in a ridiculously raw, emotional but extremely clear way. 'She deeply regrets that she ever had to end up in that situation and that it came to that. 'Yes they got it down to manslaughter, the judge seemed very sympathetic, it was battered wife's syndrome and she has post traumatic stress. 'She hates that she is in the situation, hates that it happened to her family and to his family, she's on a quest. James Polkinghorne was allegedly carrying this pipe on him when he went to Jessica Silva's house on the night of his death . Jessica Silva was been found guilty of manslaughter after stabbing her partner James Polkinghorne on Mother's Day in 2012 and was given a 2-year suspended sentence. She admitted during the proceedings that 'I thought I could change him' 'She wants forgiveness in the family she finds it hard, it was a case of kill or be killed, she had no doubt that night that she would die. 'It was chilling when she described those moments.' Usher recalls how her own family found it hard to comprehend. 'Her father tells how \"I looked into my daughters eyes and I didn't recognise her\". While Polkinghorne's family is 'dealing with what their son had become'. The young Sydney woman who stabbed her abusive estranged partner to death on the street only escaped a jail term, after the judge found the killing was done in the most 'extreme circumstances'. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. The 25-year-old domestic violence victim wept after Justice Clifton Hoeben sentenced her to two years' imprisonment. The prison term was suspended on the condition of good behaviour. Silva pleaded not guilty to her partner's murder on the basis of self-defence, but after five days of deliberation, a jury found her guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Michael Usher revealed that Jessica's motivation to tell her story to 60 Minutes was to 'send a warning to others, she did everything wrong, that she should have left at the very first sign of violence' In handing down his sentence, Justice Hoeben said he accepted Silva's comments that Mr Polkinghorne had been 'very abusive'. 'I dealt with it for so long, I thought I could change him,' Silva had said. While he found Silva did intend to cause Mr Polkinghorne grievous bodily harm when she stabbed him in his back and head, he said the situation was 'exceptional'. 'The factual circumstances are most unusual with the steady build up of fear on the part of the offender arising from the escalating threats of violence emanating from the deceased. 'The offending was committed under extreme circumstances in the agony of the moment.' During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. In one, Mr Polkinghorne threatened to 'cave her face in'. Another message, from the day he was stabbed, read: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' Mr Polkinghorne, the court heard, had become increasingly aggressive due to his use of the drug ice. Jessica stabbed her boyfriend of four years, five times after he arrived outside her Marrickville home in Sydney, fuelled on the drug 'ice'. During the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly wept in court as the jury heard a series of abusive phone calls and texts sent by Mr Polkinghorne before his death. The court heard that Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside Ms Silva's family home on the day he was killed after sending threatening text messages to her phone, months after she had ended their relationship. Ms Silva said he then punched her and ripped her pants before she ran inside to retrieve a knife with which to defend herself, while he continued to argue with her brother and father outside. Upon returning to the scene, she stabbed him in the shoulder, chest and back. Before his death, during a phone conversation between Silva and her brother Miguel, she was heard saying: 'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now\u2019. When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.' 'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'. 'I walked away drained, I really did,' Usher said. 'I have seen a lot of emotion, a lot of events, but the raw emotion was so fragile still, it left me speechless. 'You'll see there are incredibly long pauses as we give her time to talk, it left me drained, sometimes you can put yourself in people in their shoes, but not this time, it was horrific to hear.

        "input": "One of the earliest Spitfires ever to go into action has gone on sale for \u00a32.5 million after spending 40 years buried in sand on the French beach it crashed on. The Mark 1 version of Reginald Mitchell's famous design was among the first built in March 1940 but Spitfire P9374, once flown by an airman involved in the Great Escape,\u00a0never made it to the Battle of Britain as it crash-landed in May 1940. The fighter plane, dubbed the ballerina because of its grace in the skies, was being piloted by Flying Officer Peter Cazenove over Dunkirk when it was hit by a single bullet from a German Dornier bomber. Before it was lost, Spitfire P9374 was at one point almost certainly flown by Squadron Leader Roger Bushell, later 'Big X', who was part of the famous breakout from German prisoner of war camp Stalag Luft III. Scroll down for video . Back in the sky: This iconic Mark 1 plane was among the first built in March 1940, but Spitfire P9374 never made it to the Battle of Britain as it crash-landed over Dunkirk in May 1940. In 1980 the wreckage was discovered when part of it was spotted poking out from its sandy grave . Beached: German soldiers sitting on the Spitfire brought down on the wet sands at Calais by Flying Officer Peter Cazenove. It had been hit by a single bullet from a German Dornier bomber.\u00a0The plane was consumed by the sandy beach and remained there for 40 years . Captured: The fighter plane (pictured left) was being piloted by Flying Officer Peter Cazenove (right) over Dunkirk when it was hit by a single bullet from a German Dornier bomber.\u00a0Cazenove was then captured by the Nazis and taken to the Stalag Luft III prisoner of war camp . Cazenove, a 32-year-old Old Etonian of the stock-broking dynasty flying his first combat mission, had no choice but to bring the aircraft down on the wet sands at Calais, despite radioing in to say 'Tell mother I'll be home for tea!' shortly before doing so. He was then captured by the Nazis and also taken to the Stalag Luft III prisoner of war camp, famous for The Great Escape. The plane became consumed by the sandy beach and  remained there for the next 40 years. In 1980 the wreckage was discovered when part of it was spotted poking out from its sandy grave. It was corroded and covered in barnacles but amazingly still intact. The plane was dragged from the beach and taken to the Mus\u00e9e de l'Air in Paris. Sadly, Cazenove died just a few weeks before the Spitfire was discovered. Shortly before he passed away he is even said to have told his wife \u2018I wonder whatever happened to my Spitfire'. Steeped in history: A technician with the propeller of the restored Supermarine Spitfire (pictured left) at the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, Cambridgeshire, and\u00a0pilot Ken Wilkinson (right), who is photographed with the Spitfire that he flew during the Second World War . Second World War Spitfire pilot Ken Wilkinson posed next to the Mark 1 aircraft at the Imperial War Museum earlier today. The Spitfire, one of the last of its kind remaining, is due to be auctioned for charity on July 9 and is expected to fetch up to \u00a32.5million . Donation: The plane was bought by American billionaire philanthropist Thomas Kaplan after it was discovered in 1980. He had it restored to its original condition and now plans to donate the proceeds from the sale to the RAF Benevolent Fund and wildlife charity Panthera . The Spitfire P3974 after its restoration . Originally built at the Vickers Armstrong factory in Southampton, Spitfire P3974 was delivered to 92 Squadron at RAF Croydon in March 1940, one of the most celebrated squadrons in the RAF. The Merlin III engine installed in P9374 was built at Rolls-Royce, Derby, on October 27 1939. During Spitfire P9374's service with 92 Squadron it is known to have been flown by at least eight different pilots, and was almost certainly flown by the squadron's commanding officer Squadron Leader Roger Bushell, later 'Big X' of the Great Escape fame. Records show that P9374 had a total flight time of 32 hours and 5 minutes at the time of its loss. Eventually the plane was bought by American billionaire philanthropist Thomas Kaplan, who had it meticulously restored to its original condition by a team of expert engineers. Mr Kaplan, an Oxford-educated gold trader, owns both of the surviving Mk1 Spitfires. He has now listed the plane Cazenove piloted for sale through London auctioneers Christie's UK, 75 years since the Battle of Britain, with an estimate of \u00a32.5 million. He plans to donate the proceeds to the RAF Benevolent Fund and wildlife charity Panthera. The other Mk1 - N3200 - will be gifted to The Imperial War Museum Duxford. Mr Kaplan said: 'When my great childhood friend Simon Marsh and I embarked upon this project, it was to pay homage to those who Winston Churchill called The Few, the pilots who were all that stood between Hitler's darkness and what was left of civilization. 'These coming events are more than anything else, concrete gestures of gratitude and remembrance for those who prevailed in one of the most pivotal battles in modern history. 'The return to Duxford of N3200 which was itself piloted by the heroic Commander of RAF Duxford, is an act of love for Britain that began with my and Simon's mutual passion for aircraft and desire to enshrine a British legacy.' He added: 'The sale of P9374 for charity is likewise an opportunity to share that passion with others and to benefit causes that have moved me since boyhood. 'The RAF Benevolent Fund represents a way to honour that breed who gave so much for Britain when its existence was imperilled.' John Romain, pilot and chief engineer at the Aircraft Restoration Company which undertook the project, said the original Spitfire is a remarkable piece of Second World War history. He said: 'We have restored it over the last five years. It came to us quite literally in boxes of parts that had been removed from the beach in France. 'We spent five years restoring it back to its original state - it is unique in that sense. 'We have seen Spitfires at auction before, but many years ago. This one is particularly special, it is very unusual to see a Spitfire like this go to auction. 'It was a special project for me to be involved in.' Experts say the plane offers a unique insight into the skirmishes Allied pilots faced. Robert Copley, Christie's UK deputy chairman, said: 'Christie's is proud to be entrusted with the sale of this Spitfire; a truly iconic aircraft which is symbol of the bravery of The Few in the Battle of Britain'.

Records show that the P9374 Spitfire (pictured left and right) had a total flight time of 32 hours and 5 minutes at the time of its loss . When Luftwaffe commander Hermann G\u00f6ring asked his flying ace Adolf Galland what he needed to win the Battle of Britain, he replied: \u2018A squadron of Spitfires.\u2019 The plane was so feared by the Luftwaffe that many Nazi crews claimed to have been shot down by one when they had really been downed by the slower, more numerous, Hurricane. The first plane shot down by a Spitfire was an RAF Hurricane in 1939 in a friendly fire incident known as the Battle of Barking Creek. After D-Day, flying ace Johnnie Johnson organised a supply run of Spitfires with barrels of beer slung under each wing to bring the \u2018necessities of life\u2019 to pilots on front-line airfields in Normandy. Spitfires were occasionally painted pink to blend in with the sunset and sunrise when used for low-level reconnaissance flights. Its pilot, Mr Cazenove, who came from a banking dynasty, was part of the ill-fated bid for freedom from Stalag Luft after he had been captured by German forces. He did not manage to get away as he was a big man who couldn't fit in the escape tunnel - which probably saved his life. Mr Romain said: 'He got involved in the Great Escape, but luckily for him he didn't escape that day. Most of his colleagues who did were then shot. 'He came back to the UK after the war.' Spitfire P9374 is now flyable once more and will take to the skies again at IWM Duxford in the VE Day Anniversary Air Show on May 23 and 24. 'We have restored 18 Spitfires over the years but have never been asked to restore one to such an exacting standard,' Mr Romain added. 'I've done the test flying and it was beautiful to fly. It really is a beautiful aircraft. It has flown at Duxford and people there started calling it \"the ballerina\", and that nickname has stuck.' Mr Kaplan said he embarked on the project because he wanted to 'enshrine a British legacy'. Robert Copley, deputy chairman of Christie's UK, said: 'Christie's is proud to be entrusted with the sale of this Spitfire; a truly iconic aircraft which is symbol of the bravery of The Few in the Battle of Britain. 'We look forward to seeing this extraordinary Mk.1 Spitfire reach new heights at The Exceptional Sale, which will be a unique moment in auction house history.' The sale will take place in London on July 9. The Merlin III engine installed in P9374 was built at Rolls-Royce, Derby, in October 1939.\u00a0The iconic aircraft's sale will take place on July 9 .

        "input": "Nigel Farage attacked the high cost of health service treatment for foreigners with HIV in Thursday's General Election debate. The latest official figures show that more than half of those newly diagnosed with HIV in Britain \u2013 where their country of origin is known \u2013 were born overseas . When Nigel Farage attacked the high cost of health service treatment for foreigners with HIV it was guaranteed to provoke controversy. Instantly the Ukip leader was accused of \u2018dangerous scaremongering\u2019. But, while some of his claims were overstated, the latest official figures show that more than half of those newly diagnosed with HIV in Britain \u2013 where their country of origin is known \u2013 were born overseas. Mr Farage said on Thursday night\u2019s televised debate: \u2018Here\u2019s a fact and I\u2019m sure that other people will be mortified that I dare to talk about it. \u2018There are 7,000 diagnoses in this country every year for people who are HIV positive. It\u2019s not a good place for any of them to be, I know, but 60 per cent of them are not British nationals. \u2018You can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to \u00a325,000 a year per patient. \u2018I know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world, but what we need to do is put the National Health Service there for British people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades.\u2019 Labour leader Ed Miliband branded the comments \u2018disgusting\u2019 and former England captain Gary Lineker wrote on Twitter: \u2018Always reluctant to offer a political view, but Farage is a d***!\u2019 Yesterday Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg also took to Twitter to condemn the remarks, saying: \u2018Farage\u2019s comments about foreign people with HIV were simply vile and desperate. Politics of the lowest form.\u2019 Mr Miliband also tweeted: \u2018He should be ashamed. The fact he isn\u2019t says so much.\u2019 Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) branded the comments \u2018disgusting\u2019 and former England captain Gary Lineker (right) wrote on Twitter: \u2018Always reluctant to offer a political view, but Farage is a d***!\u2019 But last night Mr Farage stood by his claims, telling ITV news they were \u2018cold, hard facts\u2019. The figures on HIV and foreigners are notoriously hard to calculate because they could include British nationals who were born abroad. According to Public Health England, there were 6,000 diagnoses of HIV in the UK in 2013. Where the country of origin is known, 54 per cent of new diagnoses were foreign-born patients. However, the same body estimated that 76 per cent of all newly diagnosed HIV infections among gay or bisexual men and 57 per cent among heterosexual men and women in 2013 probably happened in the UK. The cost of antiretroviral drugs for HIV patients per year has been put between \u00a310,000 and \u00a316,000 by the National Aids Trust. Aids charity Avert has estimated that the cost of treating someone with HIV in the UK is around \u00a318,000 per year, although this varies depending on the type and number of drugs taken and the stage of HIV infection. Each HIV patient from overseas \u2013 even if here illegally, a failed asylum seeker or a student on a temporary visa \u2013 is entitled to free treatment on the health service. This \u2018free to all\u2019 policy was introduced in 2012 to try to stop the spread of the virus in the UK. Officials raised concerns about the risk of health tourism by HIV patients in a Department of Health report on their treatment, which was published in 2012 to explain the change in policy. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg also took to Twitter to condemn the remarks, saying: \u2018Farage\u2019s comments about foreign people with HIV were simply vile and desperate. Politics of the lowest form\u2019 It said: \u2018Given the high cost of ARVs [antiretroviral drugs], for all overseas visitors we recommend that advance prescribing of ARVs is for a maximum of one month in the first instance. \u2018Whilst it is unlikely that people with HIV, or at risk of HIV, will visit the UK solely for the purpose of receiving free HIV treatment, this guidance \u2026 makes clear the arrangements that will enable monitoring to ensure this is not the case.\u2019 Mr Farage\u2019s comments on HIV treatment were believed to be aimed at reviving Ukip\u2019s core vote, as part of a strategy nicknamed \u2018shock and awful\u2019. He had originally intended to warn about the relatively high proportion of migrants with tuberculosis before realising that HIV drugs are more expensive, sources alleged. During the party leaders\u2019 debate, Leanne Wood, leader of Welsh Nationalists Plaid Cymru, won the first significant applause of the night when she attacked Mr Farage\u2019s comments on HIV treatment. The Conservatives would not go into coalition with Ukip after the election, Michael Gove said yesterday. A day after George Osborne refused to rule out a deal with Nigel Farage, the Tory chief whip told the BBC: \u2018A coalition with Ukip? Nein, danke! Nein, danke is German for No, thank you.\u2019 But Labour said the answer was still not definite enough for them. Andy Burnham has written to David Cameron asking for a cast-iron guarantee there would be no Tory-Ukip coalition. Mr Farage has said he is not interested in a formal coalition. But last night he described the Prime Minister as \u2018somebody we can sit down and talk to\u2019 in the event of a hung parliament. One Ukip condition would be an in/out EU referendum by the end of 2015. She said: \u2018This kind of scaremongering is dangerous, it divides communities and it creates stigma to people who are ill, and I think you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\u2019 George Osborne, the Chancellor, asked about it afterwards, said that he would \u2018not dignify that with an answer\u2019 and Mr Miliband tweeted yesterday that the comment was \u2018disgusting\u2019. It comes after Ukip\u2019s share of the vote in recent polls has eroded significantly from highs of 19 per cent late last year, to just 10 per cent in several polls over the past month. Mr Farage has claimed he would stand down if he does not win the seat he is contesting in Thanet South. Ukip\u2019s first MP, Douglas Carswell, refused to specifically endorse Mr Farage\u2019s remarks yesterday. The former Conservative, standing in Clacton, Essex, added: \u2018It is sensible and reasonable to say we want a national health service, not an international health service, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u2019 He insisted the party was not split and added: \u2018I thought Nigel was superb in the debates. His answers were credible.\u2019 A half-time poll from ComRes/ITV News showed 24 per cent of voters giving Mr Farage the lead in the debate, but almost as many (22 per cent) thought he was also the worst of the seven leaders. Mr Carswell\u2019s father, Wilson, was a respected physician and fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons who diagnosed the first confirmed cases of HIV in Uganda in the 1970s. He was the inspiration for the character of Dr Nicholas Garrigan in the Oscar-winning movie The Last King of Scotland. Mr Farage appeared to embarrass Mr Carswell when he won his seat in a by-election in October by calling for a ban on people with HIV entering the UK. Mr Carswell said at the time: \u2018No-one is seriously suggesting we should screen people for HIV coming in.\u2019 Dr Rosemary Gillespie, chief executive of HIV charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: \u2018It was great to see so many people express outrage after Farage\u2019s comments last night about the numbers of people in the UK with HIV who were not born here. \u2018HIV is a public health issue in the UK and globally. If we do not take an inclusive approach and provide treatment for people who need it, we will never prevent onward transmission. \u2018HIV doesn\u2019t discriminate and politicians shouldn\u2019t either. Such ill-informed and discriminatory comments generate stigma, and make it harder to encourage people to take a test and stay safe.\u2019 Ed Miliband spoke of himself as a future prime minister ten times during the leaders\u2019 debate on television. In his opening statement, the Labour leader said: \u2018If I\u2019m prime minister, I\u2019ll raise the minimum wage to \u00a38 an hour and ban exploitative zero-hours contracts so we\u2019ll reward hard work again. \u2018If I\u2019m prime minister, I\u2019ll rescue our NHS, hiring more doctors and nurses. \u2018If I\u2019m prime minister, I\u2019ll build a future for all of our young people.\u2019 On migration, he said: \u2018If I\u2019m elected as prime minister, we\u2019ll put in place new rules which say that if you come to this country, you won\u2019t get benefits for at least the first two years.\u2019 On the failure of some employers to pay the minimum wage, he said: \u2018We\u2019ve got to deal with it, and if I\u2019m prime minister, I will.\u2019 Mr Miliband used the words \u2018prime minister\u2019 five more times, including in his summing-up.",

The five-star hotel in Porto celebrates all things wine - Port wine, in particular - and has the feel of a place steeped in decades-old tradition, with a prime location, classic design and unblemished attention to detail. But, to my surprise, The Yeatman has been open for just five years - a fraction of the age of some of the pricier bottles in its wine cellar. In those five years it has been hitting all the right notes, developing a reputation as a haven for wine lovers and one of Portugal\u2019s best luxury hotels. The Bacchus suite at The Yeatman boasts a high-vaulted wooden ceiling, copper Jacuzzi, fireplace and a rotating bed . Portugal's first wine hotel is built into a hill, providing sweeping views of Porto and the Douro river from the indoor pool and guest rooms . When guests arrive at The Yeatman they set foot in a stunning lobby with a statue of\u00a0Bacchus, the Roman god of wine . For guests like myself, who know little about wine but will never allow it to go to waste, it presents an opportunity to learn and develop an appreciation for the picturesque Douro region\u2019s nectar. Even though the hotel is dedicated to wine, it\u2019s not just for enthusiasts. Regardless of their knowledge or palate, guests can take advantage of two other things that The Yeatman specialises in: relaxation and imaginative food. When I arrived on a Friday night I stepped into the immaculate lobby - accentuated with a statue of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine - to the sound of an acoustic guitar drifting from Dick\u2019s Bar, the in-house bar where couples canoodle on couches and bartenders mix Port wine cocktails. With more than 80 wines by the glass it is the only bar in Porto to remain open 24 hours a day. Public spaces inside the five-star hotel, including the lobby and Dick's Bar, offer a breathtaking view of Portugal's second-largest city . The Yeatman is located in\u00a0Vila Nova de Gaia; it is separated from Porto by the Douro river, which spills into the Atlantic Ocean . The Yeatman's large decanter-shaped infinity pool is heated and surrounded by a terrace with plenty of space to lounge in the sun . From the statue of Bacchus, guests\u2019 attention usually moves to the large glass doors and windows that offer sweeping views of the river and the Luis I Bridge, which links Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia. Guests are afforded the same luxury when they enter their room and set foot on the private terrace, which has impressive views across the river of Portugal\u2019s second-largest city. The Yeatman, Portugal\u2019s first luxury wine hotel, is built into a hill in Vila Nova de Gaia, with all of its 82 rooms facing the river and almost every one themed after a Portuguese winery. Guest rooms at The Yeatman face the river, and almost all of them are themed after a Portuguese winery (pictured: superior room) Each guest room is decorated in an understated, classic style, with a private terrace where guests can relax outdoors . No visit to Porto in northern Portugal is complete without a sampling of its most famous export - Port wine. Guests at The Yeatman are just a short walk from Taylor\u2019s wine lodges and cellars, where its Port wine ages in thousands of barrels. Owned by Taylor, Fladgate & Yeatman, which owns the hotel, the compound offers informative tours and tastings, with visitors learning about the history of the sweet wine and the House of Taylor\u2019s, which is in its fourth century. After the tour guests are offered three Port wines - chip dry (extra dry white), late bottled vintage and 10-year-old tawny - and they can pay extra to sample premium Port wines. My tour included a stop inside one of the cellars, which houses nearly 2,000 barrels containing Port wine as old as 1880 and a giant barrel capable of holding 100,000 litres. Located next door to The Yeatman, Taylor's Port wine cellars offers affordable informational tours and tastings for visitors . My superior room, themed after the Quinta do Passadouro winery, was decorated with its labelled bottles, photos of its vineyard and regional artefacts, plus vintage-like furniture and lime green curtains, giving it a luxurious but laid-back feel. Like the rooms, each floor has a theme. Floor one, where the outdoor pool is located, is decorated with framed maps of Portugal, while other floors focus on local history or Portuguese discoveries. Wine is front and centre at this polished hotel, owned by centuries-old Port wine producer Taylor, Fladgate & Yeatman, but one could argue that the real star of the show is the Gastronomic Restaurant. The restaurant at The Yeatman is the only one in Porto to carry a Michelin star, offering exceptional service and creative dishes . Tasting menus include dishes such as\u00a0crispy suckling pig belly (pictured), and codfish with corn bread crumble and chickpea puree . It is the only restaurant in Porto to carry a Michelin star, and during my visit I was treated to a two-hour culinary masterclass with exceptional service and creative dishes from start to finish. The tasting menu included a langoustine broth with crunchy langoustine and Champagne sauce, roasted codfish with corn bread crumble and chickpea puree, crispy suckling pig belly with cardinal prawn slices and herb sprouts, and a chocolate cafe with toffee and caramel ice cream - all paired with Portuguese wines. Best enjoyed before indulging, guests can spoil themselves at the Caudalie Vinotherapie Spa, which offers a number of treatments that stick with the hotel\u2019s wine theme. Guests can spoil themselves at the Caudalie Vinotherapie Spa, which offers a number of treatments that stick with the wine theme . Spa visits include access to a Roman bath (pictured), sauna and The Yeatman\u2019s indoor panoramic infinity pool . Spectacular views are enjoyed from the spa\u2019s private barrel bath rooms, where guests relax in bubbling water enriched with a grape extract . I was treated to the spa\u2019s signature massage - the Caudalie relaxing massage, with grape extract oils - after spending some time in the relaxation room, which offers another impressive vantage point of the hustle and bustle across the river. TAP Portugal (www.flytap.com, 0345 601 0932) flies from London Gatwick to Porto 14 times a week, with return fares starting at \u00a3120 including all taxes and surcharges. Porto Airport is just a 20-minute drive from The Yeatman. Spectacular views can also be enjoyed from the spa\u2019s private barrel bath rooms, where guests relax in bubbling water enriched with a conditioning grape extract. The spa has two levels connected by a spiral staircase set within a giant port wine barrel, and guests also have access to a Roman bath, sauna and The Yeatman\u2019s indoor panoramic infinity pool. From the spa to the restaurant and everywhere in between, everything at The Yeatman comes back to wine, with the hotel acting as an ambassador. One of the features that should delight anyone with an appreciation for it is a \u2018working cellar\u2019 on the lower level . Open two hours every day, guests can head down with a sommelier to pick out a wine - from Portugal or another wine-producing nation - to pair with their dinner. After my two-night stay at The Yeatman I still consider myself a novice when it comes to the finer points of wine, but I left feeling confident that there will be fewer surprises the next time I pick up a bottle at the supermarket.

Loretta Burroughs, 63, sobbed throughout her sentencing as relatives of her late husband, Danny, talked about the horror of losing him and finding out that she chopped up his body and took his remains with her when she moved. Mrs Burroughs was arrested in May 2013 after Danny Burroughs' body parts were found inside the guest bedroom closet of the Ventnor home she was moving out of. Scroll down for video . Crocodile tears:\u00a0Loretta Burroughs, 63, pictured in wiping away tears\u00a0in New Jersey Superior Court in Mays Landing Wednesday, was sentenced to 55 years in prison for the murder and dismemberment of her husband . Victim: Daniel Burroughs was missing for six years before his chopped up remains were found at his wife's home in Ventnor, New Jersey, in 2013 . Grief: Raymond Wantorcik, brother of murder victim Danny Burroughs, refers to a photo of the pair stating 'This is my best friend... I won't smile like that anymore' during the sentencing of Loretta Burroughs . She had told family and friends that he had left her for another woman shortly before the couple was due to move to Florida in August 2007. Investigators testified that the containers were each wrapped in nine trash bags, with air fresheners, dryer sheets and scented beads to mask the smell. They began re-examining the case after a family member provided new information to the new cold-case unit of the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office in February 2013. Loretta Burroughs said in addressing the court that the killing wasn't planned. But friends had said she didn't want to move to Florida, which was her husband's idea, and that was her motive for killing him. In sentencing her, Judge Michael Donlo said, \u2018This court has not seen anything so brutal and heinous as this since Al Capone ordered the St. Valentine's Day massacre.\u2019 The notorious Prohibition-era gangster was believed to be behind the slayings of seven people in Chicago on February 14, 1929, by hired killers dressed as policemen. Shaking his head at the defendant, Judge Donlo marveled that she had murdered her husband just so she wouldn't have to relocate to the Sunshine State. 'Wait until you see now where you're going to go,' he told her, according to Press of Atlantic City. Loretta Burroughs was found guilty last month of first-degree murder for stabbing her husband to death, dismembering him with a knife and a saw, packing the body parts into plastic containers, and dragging them with her as she moved three times in six years. Graphic: The jury was shown how the dead man's remains had been systematically taken apart . Loretta was about to move for a fourth time on May 17, 2013, from Ventnor, New Jersey, to Villas, New Jersey, when authorities arrived at the door of her new home with a search warrant. They were investigating her for fraud in relation to the disappearance of her husband, Daniel S. Burroughs, 63, who was reported missing on September 1, 2007. Guilty: Loretta Burroughs, 63, murdered and cut up her husband then hid the body for six years . 'She asked if we were also searching the Ventnor house,' testified Sgt. Lynn Dougherty of the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office. When told that they were, Loretta's physical demeanor 'changed completely. Her whole body sunk. She lost the color in her face, she was wringing her hands, very nervous.' In the guest bedroom closet of Loretta's Ventnor home, Detective Caroline MacDonald of the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office discovered two large boxes wrapped in multiple plastic garbage bags. As she started to open the bags, she smelled the distinct odor of decomposition and called the medical examiner. The boxes were transported to the morgue. Dr Charles F Siebert Jr, a forensic pathologist, began opening the boxes. Both were surrounded by nine layers of plastic bags in alternating directions, Siebert testified. He also found dryer sheets, air fresheners, and scented beads to mask the odor of death. Inside the first container, Siebert testified, he found a woman's handbag. 'I described it as olive but I didn't know the color, because it had been sitting in decomposition fluid,' he said. Inside the handbag were a 'cranium and mandible' \u2014 a skull and jawbone. The second, larger plastic container contained more bones, including the left upper arm and lower legs. Gruesome: A woman's handbag, soaked in decomposition fluid, was found in one of the plastic totes. It contained the victim's skull and jawbone. Siebert testified that he saw cut marks on the ribs that were consistent with stab wounds. He determined that the person had died by homicide. Dr Stuart Alexander, a forensic odontologist, or dentist, from Cranbury, testified that he positively identified the remains in the plastic tote as being Daniel Burroughs. Alexander compared Burroughs' dental records to the teeth in the skull. Donna Fontana, a forensic anthropologist with the New Jersey State Police, testified about the condition of the bones in the boxes. 'There was no gnawing from animals and no bleaching of the bones,' she said. 'That means the bones were in a protected environment, with no sun exposure, and not exposed to the environment where they were attacked by animals.' Fontana then used a replica of a human skeleton and photographs to explain to the jury what had happened to the bones. She said the right tibia, which is the large bone of the lower leg, had been cut with a knife and a saw. Because the cut edge was the same color of the bone, she said it had been sawed at the time of death. Several vertebrae were missing, and others showed signs of trauma, including 'linear cuts as if produced by a knife.' Demonstration:\u00a0Donna Fontana, forensic anthropologist with the New Jersey State Police, uses a replica skeleton to show the jury where the bones of the victim's leg had been sawed. Forensic anthropologist Donna Fontana testified that all the wounds to the victim's ribs were made with a knife. The third rib on the left side was completely fractured. Fontana testified that several of the body's 24 ribs were also missing. Of the ribs that showed trauma, the injuries were consistent with knife wounds. One was completely fractured. 'There is a pattern of dismemberment,' Fontana testified. Dismemberment, she explained, is usually done 'to hinder identification and for ease of transport.' Chief Assistant Prosecutor Seth Levy argued that Loretta Burroughs murdered her husband, Danny Burroughs, for money. Danny disappeared on August 3, 2007. A few days later, Loretta told friends and family that he had left her. She said he drove off with a younger woman in a yellow Hummer with Florida license plates. In reality, the prosecutor said, Loretta had killed him, and her gruesome plot had begun months before the murder. Loretta worked at the Mey House Assisted Living Facility in Egg Harbor Township, now called Somers Place. In early June 2007, she asked attorney Enid Hyberg, whose mother was in Mey House, to draft a power of attorney. Loretta told the attorney that she and her husband were selling their home, but Danny was going out of town. With the power of attorney, Loretta could complete the sale. Hyberg drafted the document. She did not charge Loretta, 'in gratitude for the attention she was paying my mother,' Hyberg testified. A power of attorney needs to be notarized. In June 2007, Loretta asked Edward T. Dwyer, whose mother was also in the Mey House assisted living facility, if he knew anyone who could notarize it. 'She said her husband had left her, the house was sold, but the deal wasn't finished because he left,' Dwyer testified. 'I agreed to help her out,' he said. 'She was overly good and generous with my mother.' In June 2007, Dwyer asked his sister-in-law to notarize the power of attorney. Although Danny Burroughs was supposed to sign the document, he did not. Instead, the prosecutor said, Loretta signed Danny's name to it. Loss: Ray Wantorcik had to sit through the trial but said he believed the graphic images of his brother's remains were what had convinced jurors of his sister-in-law's guilt . Ray Wantorcik, right, was finally able to hold a memorial for Danny Burroughs on May 10, 2014, almost seven years after he reported his brother missing. 'My brother won this case for himself,' Ray said. Nicole DiDomizio, Loretta's daughter by another man, testified that her mother frequently signed Danny Burroughs' name. In fact, she saw her do it between four and six times. After Danny's death, the prosecutor said, Loretta used the forged document to sell their home. The profit was $77,101. But the money was locked up in escrow, and Danny was entitled to at least half of it. 'She can't get the money if she is married,' Levy, the prosecutor, said. 'But she can get it if she is divorced.' Loretta filed for divorce on February 28, 2009, 18 months after she killed her husband. She told her divorce attorney, Daniel Alsofrom of Northfield, NJ, that her husband had moved to Florida and did not give an address. Alsofrom published a notice of her divorce complaint in the Press of Atlantic City. Loretta received half of the money when she filed for divorce, and the other half when the divorce was finalized, Alsofrom testified. As a result, the prosecutor said, between the profit from the house, and selling Danny's possessions, such as his tools and his collection of remote controlled model airplanes, Loretta received close to $100,000. 'The defendant has gotten away with it for over eight years, with nothing left but the bones,' Levy said in his closing statement. 'The story ends with the defendant being $100,000 richer and Danny Burroughs in the defendant's closet.'",

        "input": "There was a time when the name of Juventus would be one to avoid in the semi-final of European competition. Those days are long gone. When The Old Lady of Turin takes her place alongside Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid on Friday, it will appear that Massimiliano Allegri has returned this great club to the elite level. In reality it will be a clash of cultures as Juventus, who have kept nine clean sheets in their last ten fixtures, plot their path to the Champions League final in Berlin. It will be painful and far from pretty if Juve, who held on to the lead Arturo Vidal gave them from the penalty spot in the first leg against Monaco, progress to the final on June 6. There were scenes of elation as a scoreless draw saw Juventus through to their first Champions League semi-final since 2003 .

Subs not used: Storari, Ogbonna,  Padoin, Sturaro, Matri. Booked: Chiellini, Tevez. Manager: Massimiliano Allegri 6. Referee: William Collum (Scotland) 7. At the final whistle Giorgio Chiellini raced across the athletics track at Stade Louis II to throw his number three shirt into the hordes of Juve supporters celebrating their first appearance in a semi-final since 2003. The feeling is that Juve\u2019s race is run. On the surface Allegri\u2019s team are looking good, 15 points clear of second placed Lazio in Serie A and heading for a semi-final against a genuine European force in a couple of weeks\u2019 time. The reality is that this team is relying on some classic Italian traits, with some stubborn defending and the dogged work of Carlos Tevez, Juve\u2019s only out ball, for some hustling up front. It works, painfully so at times, and they are certainly a long way short of the last Juventus team to reach the Champions League final at Old Trafford in 12 year ago. Back then Marcello Lippi\u2019s team had some real class, with the names of Edgar Davids, David Trezeguet, Alessio Tacchinardi and Alessandro del Piero taking Milan to a penalty shoot-out in Manchester. Today\u2019s team relies on the presence of their veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, a survivor from that defeated 2003 team, to provide some reassurance. Before this tie against Monaco, the Italian World Cup winning goalkeeper spoke about the honour and prestige for Juventus if they could reach the semi-final. The second leg was all about survival. At times this was about the darker side of the game, with Chiellini shown an early yellow card when he scandalously scooped the ball away with his hand to prevent Joao Moutinho racing clear. All three at the back - Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli - lived dangerously, a mistake waiting to happen on a tense and anxious night. Monaco were brisk and innovative, using the first half energy of their central midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia to provide the momentum for Leonardo Jardim\u2019a side. Kondogbia deserved so much more from this tie. Juventus and Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini (left) reaches out to pull the ball away from Monaco's Joao Moutinho after slipping over .

Former Manchester City and West Ham marksman Tevez puts his hands to his mouth as a well-hit strike sails off target . He had a decent shout for a penalty in the first half when he was sandwiched between Chiellini and Vidal, sent off balance when the pair squashed him as he made his way into the area. Kondogbia was awesome here and anyone who can outshine Pirlo, save for the odd killer pass for Tevez or Alvaro Morata, in the centre of midfield must be doing something right. Tevez and Morata, who was eventually replaced in the 69th minute by Fernando Llorente, should be credited for their tireless performance in this second leg because they had both picked up a virus the night before the game. Both are believed to have been sick on the pitch. It was Tevez who had Juve\u2019s best chance here, an effort that skidding wide of Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic\u2019s left hand post on the stroke of half-time. Monaco sent for Dimitar Berbatov at the break, sending on the Bulgarian striker to replace the withdrawn figure of France midfielder Jeremy Toulalan. He had a poor game here.

There was a touch of the old Berbatov in this 45 minute spell, increasing the tempo with some quick-witted first team passes and some blindside runs into the Juve penalty area. What he craved was the one chance to beat Buffon, to carve out an opening that could, at the very least, have given them another 30 minutes to get the job done.

They needed it, the one chance to beat Juve keeper Gianluigi Buffon to give them a chance of reaching the semi-final of the Champions League. Buffon was a key player here.

        "input": "The Rev. Robert H. Schuller, the Southern California televangelist and author who beamed his upbeat messages on faith and redemption to millions from his landmark Crystal Cathedral only to see his empire crumble in his waning years, has died. He was 88. Schuller died early Thursday at a care facility in Artesia, daughter Carol Schuller Milner said. In 2013, he was diagnosed with a tumor in his esophagus that had spread to his lymph nodes and began treatment. Once a charismatic and well-known presence on the televangelist circuit, Schuller faded from view in recent years after watching his church collapse amid a disastrous leadership transition and sharp declines in viewership and donations that ultimately forced the ministry to file for bankruptcy. The soaring, glass-paned Crystal Cathedral \u2014 the touchstone of Schuller's storied ministry \u2014 was sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange in 2011, and Schuller lost a legal battle the following year to collect more than $5 million from his former ministry for claims of copyright infringement and breach of contract. Scroll down for video . Minister: Rev. Robert H. Schuller  died early Thursday in California at the age of 88 . Beginnings:\u00a0. He and his late wife, Arvella (seen together in 1950) started a ministry in 1955 with $500 when he began preaching from the roof of a concession stand at a drive-in movie theater southeast of Los Angeles . Schuller, who preached in a flowing purple robe and outsized aviator glasses, suffered a mild heart attack in 1997 but was quickly back on the pulpit, saying 'the positive person' is not afraid of life's surprises. In July 2013, he was hospitalized for days after a late-night fall at his home in Orange. Schuller's evangelical Protestant ministry, part of the Reformed Church in America, was a product of modern technology. He and his late wife, Arvella, an organist, started a ministry in 1955 with $500 when he began preaching from the roof of a concession stand at a drive-in movie theater southeast of Los Angeles. The church's motto \u2014 'Come as you are in the family car' \u2014 tapped into the burgeoning Southern California auto culture and the suburban boom of post-World War II America. By 1961, the church had a brick-and-mortar home \u2014 a 'walk-in/drive-in church' \u2014 and Schuller began broadcasting the 'Hour of Power' in 1970. In 1980, he built the towering glass-and-steel Crystal Cathedral to house his booming TV ministry, which was broadcast live each week from the cathedral's airy and sunlit 2,800-seat sanctuary. At its peak, in the 1990s, the program had 20 million viewers in about 180 countries. Preaching: The Reverend Robert Schuller is seen here on January 28, 1996, urging John du Pont - whose life story was dramatized in the 2014 film 'Foxcatcher' to give up after killing Dave Schultz . Success: Schuller (seen in 1980) he built the Crystal Cathedral to house his booming TV ministry, which was broadcast live each week from the cathedral's airy and sunlit 2,800-seat sanctuary . Couple: Besides his son, Schuller and his wife, Arvella, had four daughters, Sheila, Jeanne, Carol and Gretchen. Arvella Schuller died Feb. 11, 2014, after a brief illness. The couple is seen together in 1997 . Schuller hailed from Iowa, and according to the Des Moines Register, once said 'To the degree I have been successful, I owe it to integrity. 'Integrity absolutely goes with the territory in Iowa. If you are a farmer in Iowa, you can't be dishonest. You aren't just passing through. You expect to be buried here.' Schuller's message \u2014 that 'Possibility Thinking' and love of God overcome hardships \u2014 was a uniquely American blend of Bible and psychology. It was inspired by late author Norman Vincent Peale, who wrote 'The Power of Positive Thinking.' Schuller also wrote more than 30 books, including several best-sellers. 'He was a young guy like me, and he was going out there and trying new things,' said his grandson, Bobby Schuller, who pastors his own church that includes some of his grandfather's former congregants. 'He did so many amazing, innovative things.' Unlike other televangelists, the senior Schuller's message lacked fire-and-brimstone condemnations or conservative political baggage. 'The classical error of historical Christianity is that we have never started with the value of the person. Rather, we have started from the 'unworthiness of the sinner,' and that starting point has set the stage for the glorification of human shame in Christian theology,' he wrote in his book 'Self-Esteem: The New Reformation.' Schuller had admirers that ranged from fellow evangelist Billy Graham to Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. He also was among the first foreign religious figures invited to preach on Russian television. Fundamentalists attacked him as a heretic and humanist for statements they believed denied the need for personal repentance of sin and for his tolerance of Jewish, Roman Catholic and other theologies. His friendship with President Bill Clinton raised some eyebrows among the conservative Republicans of his Orange County congregation and prompted a deluge of irate letters and telephone calls. In response, Schuller gave a sermon on tolerance. Family: In this 2010 file photo, Sheila Schuller Coleman, right, stands next to her father, Robert H. Schuller, as she delivers her sermon . Friendship: Schuller's friendship with President Clinton raised some eyebrows among the conservative Republicans of his Orange County congregation and prompted a deluge of irate letters and telephone calls (2006 file photo) 'I do let people know how great their sins and miseries are,' he said in a 1992 radio interview. 'I don't do that by standing in a pulpit and telling them they're sinners. ...The way I do it is ask questions. Are you happy? Do you have problems, what are they? So then I come across as somebody who cares about them.' Schuller sometimes cited the example of his daughter Carol, who lost part of her leg because of a motorcycle accident in 1978 but went on to become a champion skier. 'When tough times come, we need to take tough action, to hold on until the tide turns for the better, to tenaciously dig in and bloom where we are planted,' he wrote. Tough times were in store for Schuller, too. In 2006, Schuller's only son, 51-year-old Robert A. Schuller, was installed as senior pastor, the start of a carefully choreographed leadership transition. Although a father-son succession is rare in the Reformed Church in America, the Schullers considered the church a 'family business' and the move was sanctioned by the national church, officials said. Popular: At its peak, in the 1990s, the 'Hour of Power,' filmed at the Crsytal Cathedral, had 20 million viewers in about 180 countries . Guest: First lady Hillary Clinton stands in the audience before President Clinton's State of the Union Address Tuesday, Feb. 4, 1997, at the Capitol with Schuller . But the organization fell on difficult times after the younger Schuller's installation, and he left amid a bitter family feud in fall 2008. His father had removed him from the 'Hour of Power' broadcasts, and he quit as senior pastor a few weeks later. Sheila Schuller Coleman, one of Schuller's daughters, took over as the church's top administrator, and a stable of preachers, including her and her father, handled preaching duties on the 'Hour of Power.' She, too, ultimately left, taking some congregants with her to start a new ministry. The tumult in the pulpit worsened a pre-existing decline in viewership and donations, and in 2010, Crystal Cathedral ministries filed for bankruptcy, citing debt of more than $43 million. Bankruptcy filings indicated the ministry was paying significant tax-exempt housing allowances to Schuller family members and insiders. The allowances were legal but raised concerns among vendors and other creditors who had gone unpaid for months. In 2012, Schuller and his wife quit the board of directors in a dispute over copyright infringement and breach of contract. That same year, they lost a legal bid to recover more than $5 million from their former ministry. Schuller's grandson, Bobby Schuller, took the remaining congregation and founded a new church. Bobby Schuller also took over the 'Hour of Power,' broadcasting from a new location. Bobby Schuller tweeted Wednesday 'My Grandfather Robert H. Schuller passed this morning into eternal life with Christ.' 'My father-in-law passed away peacefully early this morning,' Donna Schuller tweeted. 'He was a great Dad and a great man of God.' She earlier told the Orange County Register 'He was talking normally a couple of months ago. But since the [digestive tract] procedure, he was whispering. And later, he could barely mouth words.' She told the newspaper before his death 'He doesn't seem to be in pain. He's had a wonderful life and he\u2019ll pass gracefully.' Robert Harold Schuller was born in Alton, Iowa, in 1926, and was ordained by the Reformed Church in America in 1950. He was pastor of Ivanhoe Reformed Church in Chicago from 1950 to 1955 before moving to California. Besides his son, Schuller and his wife, Arvella, had four daughters, Sheila, Jeanne, Carol and Gretchen. Arvella Schuller died Feb. 11, 2014, after a brief illness.",

Instead, the Indiana native played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer she suffered from. But as her condition worsened, the teenager became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital. She passed away at the hospital on Friday morning. As news of her death became public, thousands of people across the country - both basketball fans and not - took to social media to express their sorrow at her death, and show support for her family. Only a year and a half ago, Lauren, whose cancer saw her rapidly gain weight, had been just another teenager preparing for college after deciding to play basketball for Mount St. Joseph. But a few weeks later, she started feeling dizzy while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found her tumor and she was told she had less than two years left.

In September, doctors gave her the devastating news she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout player, Lauren's hopes of playing college basketball were put in jeopardy. However, the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition. On November 2, Lauren realized her dream of playing for the school. Incredibly, she scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'It's a dream come true,' Lauren told reporters at the time. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' At the game, Lauren said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game,\u00a0USA Today\u00a0reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Lauren played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four.\u00a0Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, Lauren's family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV before her death. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter (left) and St Patrick's Day (right) from hospital in Cincinnati . Fighter: The NCAA moved Mount St. Joseph's first basketball game forward last November (pictured) so that Lauren could achieve her dream of playing for collegiate basketball.\u00a0She scored the first and last baskets . The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' Lauren's coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' No information about a memorial has yet been released, but\u00a0Lawrenceburg Schools superintendent Karl Galey said on Twitter that schools will be prepared to assist staff and students with counseling. Heroic: Lauren, pictured left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year. She went on to play four games for the school . Dear Lauren Hill, . You are the true definition of strength, courage, power, leadership, etc etc! Your time spent on earth will never be forgotten.

        "input": "Sitting in a restaurant with friends, Teresa James pushed food longingly around her plate, desperate to eat but unable to stand the pain it would cause. Her mouth felt as if it were on fire, her gums were beginning to blister and her teeth had grown so sensitive that she knew that if so much as a sip of water came into contact with them she would wince. But Teresa\u2019s agony was tempered with pride, because when she did manage to summon a smile, it was the most dazzling at her table. Teresa James, 40 (pictured), believes the discomfort involved with teeth whitening is worth it for the end result of a bright smile . She had spent four hours earlier that afternoon bleaching her teeth and, as far as she was concerned, the considerable discomfort was worth it. \u2018Whitening has been unbearably painful at times,\u2019 says Teresa, 40. \u2018But I am obsessive about having a bright smile.\u2019 Teresa\u2019s regimen may sound somewhat masochistic, but she is one of an increasing number of women for whom whitening their teeth has become an integral part of their beauty routine \u2014 as normal as colouring their hair or waxing their legs. In America, sales of tooth whitening products have risen 300 per cent since 1996, and the trend for excessive bleaching has grown so commonplace there that dentists have coined a new word for it \u2014 \u2018bleachorexia\u2019. Symptoms include burning gums, tooth infection and the conviction that, no matter how much a tooth has been whitened, it could be paler still. Perhaps predictably, it has caught on in Britain. Almost a third of Britons are now preoccupied with whitening their teeth, and research this week revealed the highest-earning cosmetic dentists made a collective turnover of \u00a31 billion last year \u2014 a 22 per cent increase from 2010. \u2018When it is done properly, tooth whitening is a simple and safe way of improving your appearance,\u2019 says cosmetic dentist Dr Mervyn Druian. \u2018But if it is performed in an unregulated fashion, with the wrong product, it can cause enamel erosion, receding gums and infection.\u2019 Tessa (pictured) is part of a growing group of women for whom teeth whitening has become an integral part of their beauty regime . Teresa, a banking finance officer from London, started whitening her teeth five years ago, influenced by the brilliant smiles of celebrities she admired. \u2018My own teeth looked grey in comparison after years of caffeinated drinks and they were affecting my confidence,\u2019 she says. The active ingredient in most professional whitening products is hydrogen peroxide, in gel form. In October 2012, an EU council directive made it illegal in Britain to use hydrogen peroxide \u2014 which can cause sensitivity and burning when applied too often or at too high a dose \u2014 in concentrations above 6 per cent, and decreed any concentration over 0.1 per cent could be administered only by a dental professional. When carrying out the procedure, a dentist makes a mould of the patient\u2019s teeth from which a special tray is constructed. Hydrogen peroxide gel is then squirted on to the tray via a syringe, and the tray fitted over the teeth and left for 45 minutes. Teresa (pictured) started whitening her teeth five years ago having been influenced by the brilliant smiles of celebrities she admired . Usually, the first treatment is carried out at the surgery, then the patient is given syringes and the tray to use at home \u2014 45 minutes a day, for a fortnight, being the norm. The treatment normally costs up to \u00a3500, so when Teresa spotted a DIY whitening kit online for \u00a317.99, she was tempted. It looked authentic enough: a silicone tray and five syringes of bleach. Teresa isn\u2019t sure how strong this hydrogen peroxide was, or indeed even if it was hydrogen peroxide. But the tray had to be moulded to her teeth \u2014 by softening in boiling water first \u2014 then worn overnight. That\u2019s when the warning bells should have sounded, says Dr Druian: \u2018Trays should always be properly fitted by a dentist otherwise they will never fit well and can cause leakage, which irritates gums.\u2019 Lisa Arbiter (pictured)\u00a0has been bulk-buying high-strength bleach from America to whiten her teeth every month for the past 13 years . Sure enough, the minute Teresa put the tray on, her gums started to tingle. \u2018I just assumed it meant it was working,\u2019 she says. Keen to go whiter than white, she kept the bleach on for an hour \u2014 another mistake, says Dr Druian. \u2018After 45 minutes out of the syringe, hydrogen peroxide loses effectiveness. More time won\u2019t make your teeth whiter, it will just lead to irritation and sensitivity. And if you have decay in your teeth, it can enter and lead to infection.\u2019 But Teresa was so delighted with the initial results that she used her whitening kit once a week, leaving it on for longer each time. By the time she had reached her last syringe, she was bleaching for up to four hours at a time. Lisa (pictured) was just 19 when she first tried bleaching her teeth, she now says it's addictive and she'll carry on doing it for ever . \u2018My teeth were so weak and sensitive I worried they were going to fall out. I was in agony. I knew I was being irrational, but having white teeth had become a part of my identity. It was only after an evening of not being able to eat and waiting for days for my swollen gums to go down that I realised I\u2019d gone too far.\u2019 So Teresa invested in whitening toothpastes, a whitening powder and a whitening pen instead. Ironically, the changes made to the law in 2012, which were supposed to protect patients\u2019 dental health, have seen a flood of illegal DIY whitening products on to the market, alongside unqualified practitioners who cater for those \u2014 like Teresa \u2014 who can\u2019t afford a dentist\u2019s whitening service. \u2018There has been an upsurge in beauticians whitening teeth with unregulated materials,\u2019 says Dr Druian. \u2018Many use chlorine dioxide \u2014 a strong antibacterial chemical sometimes found in swimming pools \u2014 which is easier to get hold of, given the Government\u2019s restrictions on hydrogen peroxide. Lisa (pictured)\u00a0buys \u00a350 boxes of syringes of a 25 per cent solution from the U.S and insists she has no pain or side effects from the treatment . \u2018At a high concentration, this can burn gums, leading to receding, and make tooth enamel rough and porous, which leaves it prone to further staining \u2014 trapping users into a vicious cycle of whitening.\u2019 Natasha Crane, from Norwich, is suffering from suspected enamel erosion after having her teeth whitened, for \u00a330, by a beautician operating illegally. She had seen an advert on Facebook. Unknown to Natasha, aged 17, she is a year under the legal age limit for teeth whitening, but the beautician didn\u2019t check. \u2018She painted the whitening gel on with cotton wool,\u2019 remembers Natasha. \u2018It didn\u2019t feel professional or hygienic, but this was my first experience of tooth whitening.\u2019 As soon as the beautician removed the gel an hour later, and Natasha rinsed her mouth, her teeth felt agonisingly sensitive. Newlywed Donna Bilson (pictured) is a recent convert to tooth bleaching but is already very taken with it . \u2018The beautician said this was normal,\u2019 she recalls. \u2018When the pain didn\u2019t go away over the next few days I called her back, but she still said there was nothing to worry about.\u2019 After later discovering that her beautician had been operating illegally, she reported her to the General Dental Council \u2014 the regulatory body for British dentists. Since then, Natasha\u2019s teeth have grown more painful. \u2018They\u2019re so sensitive that it hurts when they come into contact with fresh air,\u2019 she says. \u2018I have to wear a scarf over my mouth outdoors. Eating is agony and I drink through a straw.\u2019 Meanwhile, her teeth are starting to turn yellow because the dentine that is underneath the enamel is becoming exposed. \u2018Not only am I in pain, but, ironically, my teeth have never looked worse,\u2019 says Natasha. Beauticians practising illegally are not the only problem, however. Increasing numbers of women are ordering industrial-strength hydrogen-peroxide whitening products online from the U.S., where there are no legal limits on levels. Donna (pictured) and her husband, Andy, both started bleaching their teeth before they got married last October . Lisa Arbiter, 33, has been bulk-buying high-strength bleach from America to whiten her teeth every month for the past 13 years. She was 19 and working as a beauty therapist when she first tried it. She buys \u00a350 boxes of syringes of a 25 per cent solution from the U.S., yet insists she has no side-effects other than sensitive teeth. \u2018At work, having white teeth makes me look more professional,\u2019 she says. \u2018And having so many pictures of ourselves plastered on social media makes it obvious who has whitened their teeth and who hasn\u2019t. Un-whitened teeth look dirty. \u2018Tooth whitening is addictive, and I\u2019ll carry on bleaching mine for ever.\u2019 According to the British Dental Health Foundation the effects of professional whitening can last for up to three years. Although her husband stopped after their wedding, Donna (pictured) has carried on and says its part of her beauty routine now . But newlywed Donna Billson \u2014 a recent convert to tooth bleaching \u2014 is already hooked on doing it far more frequently than that. Donna and her husband Andy, 34, started whitening their teeth last January in the run-up to their wedding last October. \u2018We wanted to look our best in the pictures,\u2019 says Donna, 36, a HR manager from Birmingham. They ordered \u00a355 boxes of 20 whitening strips \u2014 fabrics impregnated with 6 per cent hydrogen peroxide gel that users stick to their teeth for 45 minutes \u2014 from the States. \u2018Andy stopped after our wedding and says I don\u2019t need to whiten my teeth any more either,\u2019 says Donna. \u2018But I\u2019ll carry on. It\u2019s as much a part of my beauty routine as having my hair coloured and legs waxed.\u2019",

        "input": "A young mother wrote a heartbreaking obituary for herself before she passed away after a years long battle with cancer. Beth O'Rourke, 44, of Paxton, Massachusetts, has spent the past 7 years fighting stage four biliary cancer, and on April 16, the mother of Courtney, 11, and Seamus, 8, lost that fight. But as she stated in her obituary; 'I was a survivor.' Beth O'Rourke (above with husband Brendan and children Courtney and Seamus), 44, has spent the past 7 years fighting stage four biliary cancer and passed away April 16 . Beth (above with Brendan) wrote her own obituary . 'I died Thursday, April 16, 2015 surrounded by family, in the arms of my husband and 'anam cara', Brendan Patrick O'Rourke,' she wrote in the obituary. Anam cara means soul mate in Gaelic. She then went on to acknowledge all those she loved so much in her life, and then express just how happy she was, even though she was gone. 'I LOVED my life. I loved a long run, to sit quietly by the lake, to read and dance and sing and be silly with our children,' she wrote. 'We loved watching summer storms blow across the water. I loved to chat and laugh with my sisters and friends, until tears ran down our legs!' In the end though, she focused on her two children and her husband. 'Of all the things I did in this life, nothing compared to being with Brendan and our children. I fought every day to stay alive and to be with them. No person could ever ask for a more loving and supportive husband, always my champion, always,' she said. 'I enjoyed every moment we shared; the great ones, the sad ones, the easy and the hard. I pray they have learned to feel the deep sense of faith that I shared. No matter where this journey brings me next, I will forever carry their love with me, as I am sure there is a piece of me that will forever remain with them.' As for her own life, she said she hoped to be remembered 'with laughter, love and a good pint.' Beth and Brendan are seen above on their wedding day . Beth dancing with her father in an old family photo . Jim Heald, the owner of the Heald & Chiampa funeral home and a longtime friend of Beth, says he was not surprised at all she wrote her own obituary. 'She was a planner, and it was in her best efforts to prepare herself and her family for what was coming,' he told ABC News. 'Being in the first person is very different. I write them for the family and she did it firsthand. It's absolutely magnificent.' He then added; 'In that obituary she was teaching. She so eloquently says, \"Cancer loses grace and love wins.\" It was so profound and so true . Brendan also thought his wife's message was magnificent. 'It's pretty amazing to think that someone could write that before passing away. It's pretty amazing,' he said. 'Beth was amazing.' 'Beth was amazing,' said Brendan of his wife . Beth is seen getting her nursing degree above . In an interview with Today, Brendan once again praised his wife. 'She was so powerful,' he said. 'Most people, up until very recently, didn't even know she was sick, even though she'd been through multiple surgeries and [chemotherapy] treatments. She always had a positive outlook. She always cared more for everybody else first.' He also said that in addition to writing her obituary she planned the entire funeral so no one else would have to worry about anything after she was gone. Now family members have set up a\u00a0GoFundMe page\u00a0to try and fund her children's education, and help out Brendan, who met his wife when the two were just 14-years-old. Already $30,000 has been raised, with the hopes of making it to $100,000 from Brendan and the children. 'This is a story about a love that will live forever and will never fade or waver,' the page says of Beth. 'Her love is like the wind, we can't see it but we can feel it every single day.' I died Thursday, April 16, 2015 surrounded by family, in the arms of my husband and anam cara, Brendan Patrick O'Rourke. I was 44 years old. I was a survivor. I was blessed in this life with two amazing children; Courtney Elizabeth age 11 and Seamus Brendan aged 8. I was a Burncoat girl, raised by my mother, Eileen (Courtney) Rafferty now of Holden, and my very dear uncle, George 'David' Rafferty who predeceased me. Henry J Rafferty was my father who also predeceased me. I also leave my brother Sean P. Rafferty, sisters: Noreen Erickson and her husband Robert, Ellen R Harrity and Megan Rafferty, all of Worcester. I leave a most loving mother and father in law, James G. and Hannah 'Joan' O'Rourke; a sister, Colleen and her husband, Martin Dyer all of Worcester; a brother-in-law, James O'Rourke and his wife, Michelle (Holden) and lifelong friends Carrie Ann Buccaglia (Worcester), Maureen Grenier (Dudley), Patricia Flagg (Millbury), and many nieces and nephews. I'd like to thank my colleague, physician and dear friend Venu Bathini MD, for his care and support in this battle. You always saw me as a person and not a statistic. In addition I thank my PCP Elizabeth Murphy MD, nurses Beth and Faith and all those who cared for me during this journey. It was not easy for me to be a care receiver, but we forged a path for me that brought me further than most would have imagined. I attended Burncoat High School, Worcester State University obtaining my masters in nursing. As a 'roaming' catholic I attended Mass in various parishes. We are members of St Columba but attended St. Johns, Our Lady of the Angels and the Abbey in Spencer. Nursing was my calling, during my career I had the honor and privilege, to care for patients who were amazing people; they often gave me the strength and courage to get through my journey and the desire to return to the work of caring for others. I hope I was able to give them a fraction of what they gave me. I LOVED my life. I loved a long run, to sit quietly by the lake, to read and dance and sing and be silly with our children. We loved watching summer storms blow across the water. I loved to chat and laugh with my sisters and friends, until tears ran down our legs! Brendan and I enjoyed many trips together, most enjoyable were those to Ireland, visiting family to share a pint and some good 'craic'. And of course sitting quietly on the porch with Brendan (listening to the Red Sox). I enjoyed working for a cause, among them, the Pancreatic Cancer Alliance, whose members' spirit and dedication amazed me. Of all the things I did in this life, nothing compared to being with Brendan and our children. I fought every day to stay alive and to be with them. No person could ever ask for a more loving and supportive husband, always my champion, always. I enjoyed every moment we shared; the great ones, the sad ones, the easy and the hard. I pray they have learned to feel the deep sense of faith that I shared. No matter where this journey brings me next, I will forever carry their love with me, as I am sure there is a piece of me that will forever remain with them. But cancer does not care who it takes, who it hurts, or honor or love. It comes into your life and starts to break the threads that hold you and you are left to see pieces of yourself slip away and dreams fade. We were clung only to each other with pure love and faith binding us, in the end is when the most amazing thing happens, cancer loses its strength and grace appears. We need to see it. We accept it, and go with it. Grace and love win, not cancer. I hope to be remembered, with laughter, love and a good pint. And for my children to know \"No Momma ever did and no Momma ever will\u2026..\" Family and friends will gather to honor and remember my life at calling hours on Tuesday, April 21, 2015 from 4:00 to 8:00 pm at Heald & Chiampa Funeral Directors \u2013 The Sumner House, 5 Church Road, On the Common, Shrewsbury Center. My Funeral Mass will be celebrated in Saint John's Church, 44 Temple Street, Worcester on Wednesday, April 22nd at 10 a.m. Burial will follow in Mooreland Cemetery, Paxton. Honor my legacy and love for my children with a donation to Our Story of Love  or become involved and help fight cancer in any way you can. Forgive someone today and fill that spot with love.",

        "input": "Zero-hours worker? University John-Jo Pierce enjoys a cigar . Labour's efforts to fight off accusations of hypocrisy on zero-hours contracts were in chaos last night. Party chiefs had scrambled to shore up support for Ed Miliband after it emerged that dozens of Labour councils and MPs employ staff on the controversial contracts, which he has pledged to ban. In a further blow, Parliament\u2019s expenses watchdog rejected claims by Labour MPs that they employ staff on zero hours only because they are forced to by the Westminster system. And Labour\u2019s biggest donor Unite also lost a humiliating tribunal ruling over an employee who claims he was sacked for complaining about being employed on a zero-hours basis. On Wednesday, Mr Miliband vowed to end the \u2018epidemic\u2019 of zero-hours contracts \u2013 and blasted the Tories for failing to protect ordinary workers. But he was accused of \u2018total hypocrisy\u2019 on the issue after it emerged 68 of his MPs \u2013 including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls \u2013 had employed staff on that basis in the past two years. Labour councils, including Mr Miliband\u2019s own authority in Doncaster, have also issued 22,000 of the contracts. As the revelations emerged, party chiefs engineered a letter, signed by 100 workers and employers from \u2018all walks of life\u2019, that was also designed as a riposte to a letter signed by dozens of business leaders who backed the Tories this week. But the move backfired spectacularly last night after it emerged the signatories included a benefit fraudster, a boss who has used zero-hours workers, affluent students and a string of union and party activists. They include: . BENEFITS FRAUDSTER . One of the signatories identified herself as someone who had \u2018worked on [a] zero-hours contract\u2019, but Labour removed her name yesterday after it was revealed she had been convicted of benefit fraud in 2012. Scroll down for video . A court in Manchester heard that Kemi Saidu, 43, moved to Britain after she had a \u2018marriage of convenience\u2019 in Nigeria in December 2007. According to tax officials she lived with her \u2018husband\u2019, who was the holder of a British passport, \u2018briefly or not at all\u2019. She was not entitled to benefits because she was subject to \u2018immigration control\u2019, but she submitted a tax credits application and a child benefit claim for three children, two of whom did not live with her. The court heard that she moved in with a new partner but claimed \u00a327,888 in tax credits in two and a half years as a single person. Boss: Fashion designer Wayne Hemingway, whose firm employed intern on zero-hours contracts, and Harrods fan Tunji Offeyi, from Tooting, south London, who had treated himself to some perfume . She was caught after she applied for leave to remain in Britain on the basis of her \u2018marriage\u2019. Officers found she had been fraudulently claiming benefits and had allowed others to use her name and national insurance number to work illegally in the UK. In July 2012 she was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and 150-hour community work order after she pleaded guilty to immigration and fraud charges along with her \u2018husband\u2019 who had been working at HMRC as a security officer. A Labour spokesman said last night: \u2018More than 6,000 people have now signed our letter from all walks of life across the country. \u2018Of course we were unaware of the background of this person. The fact still remains that the epidemic of zero-hours contracts are a symbol of the failure of this Government\u2019s economic plan.\u2019 CIGAR-SMOKING STUDENTS . Other signatories included 21-year-old Manchester University students John-Jo Pierce and Rory Somerville. Facebook pages of the pair \u2013 who said they were working zero-hours contracts \u2013 included photographs of them smoking cigars whilst dressed in black tie. Black tie: Rory Somerville, aged 19, pictured at a university ball . Mr Pierce, who is studying maths, is registered on the electoral roll at his mother's \u00a31million house which is set in woodland near Leatherhead, Surrey. His mother Deirdre, 55, yesterday said he was \u2018just a kid\u2019 who \u2018knows nothing about politics\u2019 but had signed the letter after he was asked to by a fellow university student \u2018he vaguely knows\u2019. She told the Mail: \u2018All he did was sign a petition that somebody called Andrea asked everybody to sign. He knows a little but not much. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s been interested in an election.\u2019 She declined to discuss what work he was doing on a zero- hours contract. Mr Somerville, who is in his final year studying economics, is registered to vote at his mother's house, in an affluent area of Belfast. Mr Pierce was also photographed at a party in front of a sign that said \u2018Drugz Room\u2019, but Mrs Pierce said it was just a \u2018joke\u2019 sign that was a reference to the US television programme Breaking Bad. She said: \u2018John-Jo has never done drugs in his life. It\u2019s a joke about Breaking Bad. That\u2019s what people of that age do. They all make jokes.\u2019 Mr Somerville did not respond to a request to comment. The ZERO-HOURS BOSS . Fashion designer Wayne Hemingway went into meltdown on live television after it was pointed out that his own firm took on interns on a zero-hours basis. Mr Hemingway, co-founder of the fashion label Red or Dead, was one of the few business figures willing to put their name to Labour\u2019s letter. He said he had agreed to sign up \u2018because I want to see a party that starts to commit to reducing the inequality gap\u2019. But he became angry when BBC reporter Tim Willcox pointed out that his own firm had advertised for staff on a zero-hours basis. Mr Hemingway said the policy had now changed, adding: \u2018It is in the past \u2013 we have changed. Are we not allowed to change? We realised it was wrong and we changed two years ago.\u2019 He said there was a big difference between using unpaid interns and employing someone on zero-hours. Yesterday, the firm said it still takes on unpaid interns on a short-term basis, although those staying longer are offered payment. HARRODS SHOPPER . Last night, it was revealed that trade union officials had hurriedly tried to persuade supporters to sign the pro-Labour letter just hours after the critical letter from business leaders had been published. Tunji Offeyi, from Tooting, South London, who had previously worked on a zero-hours contract as a hospital porter, said he got an email from Unite on Wednesday. Party chiefs  scrambled to shore up support for Ed Miliband after it emerged dozens of Labour councils and MPs employ staff on zero-hour contracts . His Facebook page showed him posing with a Harrods shopping bag in December last year. Mr Offeyi last night said he had not been on a zero-hours contract at the time and had treated himself to some perfume. Others listed as workers on zero- hours contracts included Stacey Booth, an administration assistant at Leeds Council, who is a convenor for the GMB union. Another signatory, Rema Boumerdassi, was found to be a member of the shop workers union Usdaw. Her Twitter page describes her as a single parent and shows her and other union members posing with Russell Brand. Baris Yerli also said he used to work on a zero-hours contract, but his online CV revealed his other former jobs included working as a political office assistant at Unite. LABOUR LUVVIES . The letter claimed to be from people from \u2018all walks of life\u2019 but among the signatories were Labour councillors and a former MP. Derek Wyatt, 65, was MP for Sittingbourne but stood down at the last election. Others included Stephanie Elsy, the former Labour leader of Southwark Council who now runs her own political consultancy, and Kevin Craig, who is a Labour representative on Lambeth Council. Billy Boyle, the scientist husband of Kate Gross, a former No10 aide who ran Tony Blair\u2019s Africa charity and died on Christmas Day aged 36, was also a signatory of the letter. EX-BBC BOSS . Sir Michael Lyons, a former chairman of the BBC Trust, was among signatories to the letter \u2013 despite his own high earnings and questions over his role in approving fatcat pay-offs at the Corporation. In 2013, he faced a grilling from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee over pay-offs, including a \u00a31million package for outgoing director-general Mark Byford in 2011. At the BBC, Sir Michael\u2019s salary was \u00a3131,000, despite the fact he worked a four-day week. His jobs since leaving the broadcaster have included a lucrative role on the board of construction firm Mouchel, where he was interim chairman on a \u00a3300,000 salary for a time. He is also an ex-Labour councillor and wrote a report for Ed Miliband in his role as his housing guru. THE PLUS SIZED BLOGGER . Callie Thorpe is listed on the letter as a receptionist, but online she also describes herself as a \u2018plus-size style and lifestyle blogger, fan of lipsticks, food, travel and self love\u2019. The 25-year-old, who lives in London, wrote on her web page: \u2018Travelling the world has always been a passion of mine, especially Thailand and I thought I would share with you the best five weeks of my life hoping that I can impart some knowledge if you too are looking to travel around Thailand or Cambodia.\u2019 She has also posted photographs of trips to Berlin, Paris and Amsterdam. She is a size 18 to 20.",

        "input": "The brave man who stood up against a neo-Nazi at an anti-Islam rally has spoken out about the poignant moment that was captured on camera. During the Reclaim Australia rallies on the Easter weekend, anti-racism protester Jacob King was snapped staring into the eyes of a bald man with a swastika tattooed behind his ear. Mr King, from Melbourne, told Daily Mail Australia he had his arms spread out because he thought the man was going to attack him and his fellow protesters at Federation Square. Anti-racism protester Jacob King, from Melbourne, had a face off with a neo-Nazi at the Easter weekend's Reclaim Australia rallies . Mr King was raised in Melbourne and says he lived in a multicultural part of the Victorian capital where he was exposed to racial tensions . The anti-racism protester said he learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to 'unlearn' these views' 'A few scuffles broke out as a result of those trying to push and fight their way through the picket lines,' he said. 'I remember looking at the bald man from the photo and it seemed to me that he and his group were there solely to be violent and express incoherent hatred, which took away from the already limited opportunities to engage in civilised discussion. 'I have however felt this kind of anger before, and this understanding produced in me a moment of unexpected compassion for him. 'I placed myself in between him and the anti-racism protesters. My arms were outstretched to keep people back and when the man got in my face I was expecting him to attack me. But he didn't. 'As he began to relax I told him there would be no more fighting today. I wasn't expecting him to comply so easily, but I respect him for doing so.' Mr King said he was born and had grown up in a multicultural part of Melbourne, where he had been on the giving and receiving ends of 'racial prejudice and bigoted views'. 'I learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to unlearn and re-learn enough to accept that many of my simplified views were irrational,' he said. 'I have learned that the vast majority of Australian Muslims have come to Australia to improve their lives, contribute to our society and are against the extremist interpretations of their faith which they are so often accused of holding. Mr King said he had spread out his arms to protect his fellow protesters because he thought the man and his group was going to attack them . Wearing a Harley Davidson sleeveless hoodie, which showed off his sleeve of tattoos, the bald man attempted to start a fight with the protesters against racism, who stood against him in defiance . 'I attended the anti-racism rally because I recognise that the issues raised by the rally co-ordinators are a direct result of the scapegoating and fear mongering of Muslims and other minorities by many in the corporate mainstream media and government. 'I firmly believe these divisions in our society are distracting us from the more immediate issues that should be of greater concern to all Australians.' Numerous images emerged showing fiery scenes around the nation, but the most striking picture was taken by photographer Kenji Wardenclyffe who captured Mr King during the Melbourne protest against the 'Islamisation' of Australia. The dramatic scenes occurred after Reclaim Australia, an anti-Islam group, organised protests at major cities across Australia, which were countered by anti-racism activists who held rallies in the same locations. The Reclaim Australia event in Melbourne was also crashed by neo-nazis, who spectacularly clashed with anti-racism groups. 'It was very intense,' Kenji Wardenclyffe told Daily Mail Australia. 'The neo-nazi definitely seemed to be instigating, trying to start a fight with the anti-racism group. The other man in the photo stepped in and was trying to keep the peace. 'He kept his hands open, he was trying to stop a fight from breaking out.' The violent intent of the bald man was proven elsewhere at the rally, when he was photographed with one fist gripping another protester's shirt and the other raised to punch the man in the face. Mr Wardenclyffe said he was pushed around by protesters throughout the day, and some of his camera equipment was broken by people attempting to stop him from taking photos. 'It was a very angry atmosphere - it definitely seemed some of the people on the Reclaim Australia side were there looking to start a fight,' he said. 'It was very tense.' Violent intent: At the rally, the man involved in the standoff was seen trying to throw a punch at another protester as the scene descended into violence . One man appeared to be knocked out cold in the melee and was left lying on the ground . The identification of Jacob King comes after a Federal Government MP reported a group 'socialist ratbags' who were seen burning the Australian flag at the rally to the Human Rights Commission. The trio were at a Reclaim Australia demonstration, the same rally where Mr King was photographed. George Christensen, member for Dawson in Queensland revealed on Tuesday after receiving 'a number of complaints' he had reported the 'clowns' who burnt the flag while protesting against the Reclaim Australia group. 'I have asked the Racial Discrimination Commissioner to investigate the protests to see if they are unlawful under Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act,' Mr Christensen said. 'According to the Act, it is unlawful to perform any action in public that is likely to offend people of a particular race, religion, or national background. If sections of the Act can be applied to one race or nationality it must apply to all, whether a minority or the majority,' he also wrote. The rally was just one of a dozen which took place in cities across Australia on the Easter long weekend, organised by anti-Islam group Reclaim Australia.

George Christensen, member for Dawson in Queensland (left) revealed on Tuesday after receiving 'a number of complaints' he had reported the 'clowns' (right) In a video of the event, it also appears to show the moment a man throw a punch at the head of a female anti-racism protester. Despite Reclaim Australia's promise of a peaceful protest, a number of men with shaved heads and tattoos of the swastika appeared at the event and attempted to intimidate anti-racism protesters. Reclaim Australia describe themselves as 'patriotic Australians' who protest against Sharia Law, Halal tax and Islam. They say they want 'compulsory singing of our national anthem weekly in every school in Australia' and want the government to 'refuse entry to anyone who has fought overseas against our ADF or minimum 15 years jail term.' Police were forced to separate  supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country. Crowd numbers continued to grow throughout the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics after the ugly clashes. Police were forced to separate Reclaim Australia supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country . Speaking to Buzzfeed, photographer Wardenclyffe said one of the anti-racism protesters stood out in front of the rest to stop him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi appeared and pushed through the crowd and began to yell at the (left-wing protestors),' Mr Wardenclyffe said. 'The neo-Nazi then got in the face of the man in my photo with sunglasses who had moved into a position to prevent him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi yelled at him in a manner which seemed to be an attempt to start a fight, but the guy with sunglasses remained calm and didn't engage.' A clash of anti-Islam and anti-racism groups turned dangerous and violent during protests in Melbourne . Melbourne police formed a barrier between the separate rallies to attempt to disperse the protesters . It comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups has mocked protests . There was never a violent exchange between the groups however the men with the swastika's moved through the crowd taunting the anti-racism protesters. The clash comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups mocked  protests being held around Australia last week. However, organisers behind the Sydney protest were quick to disassociate themselves with the account. Crowd numbers grew during the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics . Across Australia, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, but Sydney and Melbourne drew the biggest crowd . 'It's not us,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Ours is @reclaim_aus.' Across the country, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, with events in Sydney and Melbourne appearing to have drawn the biggest crowds. About 500 people attended the rally held in Martin Place, Sydney, which included speeches from former Australia Defence League member Shermon Burgess and Rise Up! Australia Party NSW President Norm Bishop. Two people were taken away by police officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally . More than 100 police officers, eleven mounted on horses were used to form the separation wall . Several were injured during the violent rally that saw hundreds of people protest for anti-racism . There was a strong police presence throughout the protest, which included riot police. Two people were taken away by officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally. One took the microphone and told the crowd they should be 'ashamed'. Several more were injured in the combative protests, according to reports.

        "input": "Concerns are raised about Labour's policy under shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt . The heads of some of Britain\u2019s best state schools today warn of the dangers of a Labour government reversing radical education reforms. In a letter to the Daily Mail, 80 current and former leaders say there is clear evidence that academy-style freedoms are benefiting a generation of children. But they say Labour \u2013 and some senior Lib Dems \u2013 appear to be threatening to reimpose state controls. The letter, signed by the heads of good and outstanding autonomous schools, was backed yesterday by David Cameron. In it, they claim there is evidence that the most successful education systems benefit from schools with academy-style freedoms. They say such schools are more likely to be ranked \u2018outstanding\u2019 by Ofsted and more likely to improve. \u2018Secondary schools which have converted to academy status outperform other schools \u2013 by a margin of almost 10 per cent,\u2019 they wrote. But the heads expressed alarm at comments by Ed Miliband that Labour would reimpose \u2018a proper local authority framework for all schools\u2019. Senior Lib Dems were also accused of suggesting they no longer support freedom for acdemies, which are able to control pay, conditions and the curriculum. \u2018This is not the time to stop something that is working to the benefit of so many children in schools,\u2019 wrote the heads. Schools on the letter include Torquay Boys\u2019 Grammar School, ranked in the top 100 for GCSE results this year. United Westminster Schools in London is also on the list, and includes Grey Coat Hospital \u2013 where Mr Cameron\u2019s daughter Nancy starts this year. Tom Clark, chairman of Freedom and Autonomy for Schools National Association, which organised the letter, added: \u2018Our only concern is that the autonomy which has worked well for pupils stays in place.\u2019 Mr Cameron said yesterday: \u2018Ed Miliband would put all this at risk.\u2019 The letter, signed by the heads of good and outstanding autonomous schools, was backed by David Cameron . As the General Election campaign turned to education yesterday, the Prime Minister also attacked Labour yesterday for opposing the expansion of free schools \u2013 which are run by groups such as teachers, parents and charities and are outside of local authority control. He said the opposition\u2019s antipathy appeared to be based on a concern that \u2018if we set up a good new school, everyone will want to go there\u2019. \u2018Yes \u2013 that\u2019s the whole point,\u2019 he told the Mail. \u2018How can you possibly be against an excellent school setting up another excellent school?\u2019 He accused Labour of being \u2018anti free schools\u2019 for suggesting it wants to scrap the scheme. \u2018It\u2019s that mindset that says choice, freedom, responsibility, aspiration \u2013 that these are things to worry about rather than celebrate,\u2019 he added. The education reforms, masterminded by Michael Gove, have been hailed by Mr Cameron as the most important \u2018for a generation\u2019. Ed Miliband has said Labour would \u2018have a proper local authority framework for all schools\u2019 We write as current and former headteachers and school leaders of good and outstanding autonomous schools across the country committed to the very best in state education. FASNA \u2014 the Freedom and Autonomy for Schools National Association \u2014 has helped build a consensus over 25 years which recognises that diversity and self-determination help shape outstanding education. We are firmly committed to the maintenance of current academy freedoms. International evidence shows that the most successful education systems benefit from schools with academy-style freedoms. The freedoms which have come with academy status have helped FASNA schools to improve education for children in our own schools and also enabled us to work better together to raise standards in other schools. The evidence shows that primary schools which have converted to academy status are doing better than other schools \u2014 they are more likely to be ranked \u2018outstanding\u2019 by Ofsted and are more likely to improve from \u2018good\u2019 to \u2018outstanding\u2019. Secondary schools which have converted to academy status out-perform other schools by a margin of almost 10 per cent. But as school leaders we are concerned that recent statements from Liberal Democrat and Labour politicians suggest they might not protect all the freedoms which schools and teachers now enjoy and which are helping to drive up standards across the board. Though Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt said that Labour would not \u2018go back to the old days of the local authority running all the schools\u2019, Ed Miliband has said Labour would \u2018have a proper local authority framework for all schools\u2019. And a Liberal Democrat education spokesman told a recent FASNA conference that he could not support the freedom for schools to vary pay and conditions or to vary the curriculum, and he felt that schools needed local control. Any erosion of school freedoms through local authority or government regulation or overbearing \u2018middle-tier\u2019 structures will reduce the capacity of schools to perform well in the future. We call on all political leaders to guarantee that all current academy freedoms, including those relating to pay and conditions and the curriculum, will be maintained after the General Election. This is not the time to stop something that is working to the benefit of so many children in schools. The letter was signed by: .

        "input": "Host commentator . So that's it from the Sportsmail live coverage of Real Madrid versus Granada. Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo (five, yes, five), Karim Benzema (two), Gareth Bale and a Diego Mainz own goal secure a huge win.\u00a0Robert Ibanez scored Granada's consolation. Thanks for following our coverage. If you enjoyed it, why not follow our minute-by-minute updates of Tottenham Hotspur's trip to Burnley back in the Barclays Premier League. Our live coverage has started HERE. That's it at the Bernabeu. Final score, Real Madrid 9-1 Granada. The biggest win of the La Liga season and what a way for the home side to get back to winning ways after El Clasico! 90 mins: A fifth for Ronaldo. He heads in at the far post from Modric's cross.\u00a0Real Madrid have managed half the amount of goals Granada have scored in total all season, before today, in just this game! 88 mins: Good stop by the Spanish keeper as he denies Granada a second goal, saving at his near post. 83 mins: It's a tough job stopping Ronaldo, but you don't help yourself when you put the ball in your own net. Luka Modric crosses in, with the Portuguese forward at the far post but the ball doesn't even reach him. Diego Mainz puts his past his own goalkeeper. That's eight. 82 mins: Hernandez is brought down for a foul and Ronaldo and Bale shape up to take the subsequent free-kick from 25 yards. The Portuguese forward takes it and hits it through the wall but well wide. 74 mins: The very definition of a consolation. Robert Ibanez breaks through, Ramos lets him cut inside and Casillas can't quite stop it from finding the net. Not a perfect afternoon for Real Madrid. 72 mins: Useless, this bloke, isn't he? Ronaldo can't manage a fifth goal as he stretches to reach Jese's cross but sends the ball wide of the goal. 70 mins: No let-up here, Bale plays the ball into Ronaldo but it gets stuck under his feet and his finish is wide of the left-hand post. 68 mins: A great cross from Marcelo finds Manchester United loan star Hernandez but it ends up in the goalkeeper's hands. 66 mins: He scored with a free-kick for Wales during the international break and Gareth Bale almost repeats the trick here. His curling effort from the right-hand side hits\u00a0Oier Olazabal's side netting. 61 mins: An excellent return to the side for James Rodriguez ends as he is replaced by Jese. Two-goal Karim Benzema is replaced by Javier Hernandez too. 56 mins: 7-0. That's S-E-V-E-N. Benzema finds the net again. His shot is deflected into the net by the defender but they all count. Embarrassing for Granada. Real Madrid are ruthless and there could be more with 34 minutes to go. 54 mins: Bale's had criticism for not passing to Ronaldo recently, but he's laid a goal on a plate for the four-goal hero here. Granada so poor in defending as the Welsh winger latches on to a ball played over the top, he knocks it across goal to give Ronaldo an open net to finish into. It looks like he's hurt himself in a collision with the goal but should be alright. 52 mins: And it's five! The corner is put in by Rodriguez, Benzema is allowed to control it on his chest inside the box and he strikes a beauty into the top corner of the net. Awful defending on. Real's BBC have come under some stick of late but they've all scored here. Ronaldo gets us started at the Bernabeu. Can he get even more goals in this second half? 15 minute break at the Bernabeu. 4-0 at the half-time whistle and Ronaldo has been at his rampant best. Cutting Barcelona's La Liga lead is a formality for Real. 44 mins: That's more like it from the visitors.\u00a0Youssef El-Arabi hammers in a shot from outside the area but it cannons off the crossbar and down on to the line. Definitely not over, so no controversy, but Granada have come close. 43 mins: Have Granada given up? Ronaldo turns provider this time, crossing from the right-hand side into Benzema but the keeper gathers. 38 mins: This is getting silly now. it's a landslide. Ronaldo brings the ball forward and he blasts it past the goalkeeper from the edge of the box. It's an eight minute hat-trick for the Ballon d'Or winner and Real Madrid are out of sight. 36 mins: Ronaldo plays the ball out to Marcelo, it's crossed in and the goalkeeper can't deal with it, palming it out to the feet of Ronaldo. Is there anyone worse to put the ball on a plate for? The former Manchester United man smashes the ball in and it's 3-0. He's top scorer in Spain now ahead of Messi. 34 mins: Ronaldo is now level on goals for the season with Lionel Messi. 32 this campaign. It's relentless from Real Madrid at the minute but Granada stop them with plenty of bodies back. Plenty more goals to come here at a sunny Santiago Bernabeu. 30 mins: That's game over. Ronaldo makes it 2-0. Benzema makes a mess of a cross but the Granada defence are all over the place. It comes out to James Rodriguez who pulls off a great flick to gift Ronaldo the ball and he finishes confidently. 25 mins: Gareth Bale breaks the deadlock and gives Real Madrid the lead! The Welshman is played in by a brilliant pass from Toni Kroos, he does well to round the goalkeeper and just keeps it in to finish off the move and give his side the lead. 22 mins: How has Alvaro Arbeloa not scored? Real's full backs are both up in the opposition half and Marcelo whips a dangerous cross into the penalty area from the right. Arbeloa meets his tantalising ball but somehow his effort goes wide. On target and it was almost certain to be a goal. Poor. 18 mins: Real have been on top but it's the opposition who come close here. It's a great chance for Granada as Sergio Ramos refuses to close down Robert Ibanez after a terrible throw from Iker Casillas but luckily for the Real Madrid pair, the Granada man drags his shot inches wide . 16 mins: The pressure is on Granada now, Real have two corners in a row. Taken by Rodriguez and Toni Kroos but both set-pieces come to nothing. 13 mins: Lovely stepover from Cristiano Ronaldo on the left-hand side of the box and he fires in a shot early that leaves the goalkeeper fooled. Unluckily for him it hits the side netting. Real Madrid are finding their feet. 10 mins: Big error by Juan Carlos, he misses a long ball over the top ahead of his goalkeeper and Gareth Bale is ready to pounce. The Welshman unfortunately nips the ball over the bar between the two Granada men but Real are getting closer. 8 mins: Excellent cross from James Rodriguez, looking sharp despite just returning to the first team. It finds Benzema at the back post and he slides in to finish but his shot is straight at the goalkeeper. Real's first chance. Granada have every player inside their own half, gives you an impression of how this one is going to go... 6 mins: Granada manager Abel Resino must have been working hard on that high line this week, Karim Benzema is caught offside now, Real struggling to find a way through in the opening minutes despite dominating possession. 4 mins: Cristiano Ronaldo has just been ruled offside as Real Madrid try to start an attack. The Granada back four of\u00a0Foulquier, Babin, Mainz and Carlos are playing a fairly high line so let's wait and see if Real can catch them out. Here we go as Real Madrid look to take the lead at the top of La Liga. Granada get us going. Not long until we kick off now, Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and co are almost ready. Granada are second-bottom of La Liga so this game should represent a great opportunity for them to reel in Barcelona before they play Celta Vigo later this evening. The\u00a0Andalusian side have lost three of their last five games but Real's form is similarly poor, matching their losses over the same period. Marca's front page yesterday spoke of how Real want to win their last 10 games to take the La Liga title. Can they start on that road today? Granada go with 4-2-3-1. Pretty attacking team for a trip to the Bernabeu. Will their bravery pay off? Olazabal; Foulquier, Babin, Mainz, Carlos; Rico, Iturra; Ibanez, Rochina, Candeias; El Arabi. Carlo Ancelotti had confirmed that James Rodriguez would be back in the Real Madrid side during his press conference on Saturday, and his words ring true. The Colombian playmaker starts in place of Isco, who is suspended. Alvaro Arbeloa comes in for Dani Carvajal and Raphael Varane is in for the injured Pepe. Here's the Real Madrid team for this morning's game: Casillas; Arbeloa, Ramos, Varane, Marcelo; Modric, Kroos; Bale, Rodriguez, Ronaldo; Benzema. Cristiano Ronaldo scored five, including a seven-minute hat-trick, as Real Madrid beat sorry Granada 9-1. Gareth Bale broke the deadlock and Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s team were 4-0 up before half time as they put memories of their Clasico defeat to Barcelona a fortnight ago behind them. The huge gulf in class showed in the midday sunshine at the Bernabeu right from minute 20 when Bale bullied Diego Mainz off the ball and charged through on goal. He dribbled around flailing Granada keeper Oier Olazabal before nudging the ball over the line for 1-0.",

        "input": "The mother of Nicholas Figueroa, a 23-year-old male model who died in a building explosion on New York City's 2nd Avenue last month, has spoken out . Ana Figueroa, 55, told Daily Mail Online that though\u00a0she cries every night, those responsible for the explosion and handling its aftermath have not reached out to her. 'Nobody's spoken to me, no one has called to give condolences,' she said at a memorial to her son that was set up Thursday at the site of the disaster that killed two and destroyed three buildings on March 26. Scroll down for video . Ana Figueroa (pictured with husband Nixon) has spoken out for the first time since her son Nicholas, 23, died in a gas explosion on New York City's Second Avenue . The young man and recent college graduate was paying the bill on a blind date at a sushi restaurant when three buildings in New York's East Village were destroyed . Her Upper East Side family, which includes Nicholas's father Nixon, 52, and his three younger brothers Brandon, Neal and Tyler, says it still 'wants justice' and those responsible for the explosion to be punished. However, nearly one month after the blast that killed Nicholas when he was on a blind date at a sushi bar, answers about what exactly happened in the explosion remain unclear. In early April, according to the New York Post, a plumber allegedly admitted to law enforcement that he created an illegal gas connection in the building. allegedly at the request of Michael Hyrnenko, the son of landlord Maria Hyrnenko. Mrs Figueroa said that she had not been contacted by Ms Hyrnenko and has only learned about her life after reading it in media reports. She has learned that Ms Hyrnenko is also 55 and also has four children and said Thusday, 'I wonder how she would feel if she were to lose her kid'. While he said that they didn't want to 'blame' anyone, Mr Figueroa said that the family 'wants someone to come forward and say that they did this'. Nicholas's mother, who has not previously spoken at length to the press, said she had contacted a lawyer about filing charges against the landlord, though she is waiting until after the results of the city's investigation. The Figueroas say that\u00a0neither the landlord of the demolished buildings, Mayor Bill de Blasio nor Con Edison have contacted them with condolences following their loss . The family, who are afraid that their son's death and its cause will be 'put under the rug' have set up a memorial at the site of the explosion . Mrs Figueroa, who was hugged by passersby who saw the memorial to her son, said that she still cries every night . A wall has been placed around the site of the explosion, which destroyed buildings at the corner of Second Avenue and Seventh Street and damaged windows on one adjacent . Attempts by Daily Mail Online to contact Mrs Hyrnenko, who switched lawyers after the explosion, for comment were unsuccessful. Beyond Ms Hyrnenko, the Figueroa family said that other parties such as utility company Con Edison and the owner of Sushi Park, where Nicholas was eating when he died, bear some responsibility for his death. Mrs Figueroa faulted them for not stopping gas flow to the building and continuing to run a restaurant in a dangerous situation. 'Everybody has a part of this', Nixon Figueroa said Thursday. Now the Figueroas are left with their son and brother's death as the story fades from headlines, and the feeling that swiftly finding the person responsible is not a priority for authorities. 'They're going to say ''It's only two lives, it could have been more'', but it was my son', Mrs Figueroa said on Thursday as passersby hugged her in consolation. The explosion resulted in the deaths of Nicholas and Moises Locon, 26, a busboy at Sushi Park. Her family was last contacted by New York City authorities before the April 7 funeral for Nicholas, when help with services were offered. A GoFundMe page in memory of Nicholas met it's $30,000 goal, and the Figueroas did not take the city's help. Despite the relatively small number of victims, Mrs Figueroa said that she had not received a phone call from Mayor Bill de Blasio. 'We're nobody,' she said. 'Now I really need their help if we don't want this to be pushed under the rug'. A spokesman for the Mayor released a statement to Daily Mail Online saying: 'Following the East Village building collapse members of the administration were in regular communication with the families of the victims . 'Additionally, the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City raised more than $150,000 for the victims of the tragedy and the administration's offer to assist with funeral arrangements was declined.' Nicholas Figueroa, (left) a former model, and Moises Locon, 26 (right), both died at Sushi Park restaurant . New York City officials offered to help pay for Nicholas's funeral in early April, though the family was able to pay for it with help from a GoFundMe page . Mrs Figueroa was in tears at the funeral as she held a red rose and wore a button remembering her oldest son . Though the memorial set up on Thursday is a sorrowful reminder of her family's loss, the mother says that her sadness has mixed with anger over fears that her son will have 'died in vain' and no one will be held responsible. Ms Figueroa referenced other New York City incidents such as a crane collapse in 2008 that killed two and a fire in 2010 where those judged responsible faced manslaughter charges. The owner of the crane company and three men connected to the 2010 fire were all acquitted. She knows that the odds of a criminal conviction are small, but hopes that those responsible will help establish a small park on the property in memory of her son, who loved nature and meditating. The grieving mother said that those responsible include Con Edison, the utilities giant that said part of the building's gas works failed inspection about an hour before the explosion. She has also yet to be contacted by officials from the company. Con Ed released a statement to Daily Mail Online saying: 'We said on the day of the explosion and since then, that our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this tragedy, and we made a significant contribution to the Mayor's Fund to help those affected.' Ms Hyrnenko's building had previously failed a Con Ed inspection in August, when workers discovered that a pipe had been tapped in a dangerous way, the company told the New York Times. Mrs Figueroa said that illegal gas tapping should not be a 'three strike' policy and that gas to the building should have been shut off completely following the second failed inspection. A Con Edison spokesman told Daily Mail Online that the March 26 inspection was on 'work the building owner was doing in connection with the installation of a new service'. The spokesman said 'The work did not pass the inspection and our inspectors left. The new service was locked, meaning that gas could not be accessed by it.' A plumber allegedly admitted to law enforcement earlier this month that he had created an illegal gas connection at the site of the explosion . Smoke from the fire was visible from around New York City as firefighters worked to combat the blaze on March 26 . The investigation into the incident by police and fire authorities is ongoing, with much of the suspicion falling on the buildings' gasworks . Con Edison has previously said that it was replacing a small pipe with a larger one that would allow both the building residents and the sushi restaurant to receive gas. Restaurant owner Hyeonil Kim told the New York Times he believed that the residents had been getting gas since the summer from a pipe coming from Ms Hyrnenko's other building next door. Gas is thought to have still been flowing through the old piping after the inspectors left. After the inspectors left, Ms Hrynenko's son Michael was down in the basement investigating a gas leak during the explosion. He was carried out by a general contractor with him. 'Our understanding is that the criminal investigation continues,' the company said in a statement. For now the mother is left with only pictures and messages from her son. Her last texts from Nicholas, with whom she would talk about 'everything' including \u00a0include message where he asks her to cook his favorite chicken for dinner. The young man had just gotten his bachelor's from Buffalo State College and had been home for three months before he died. Right before meeting his blind date at Sushi Park, Nicholas, a former model, had texted that he was about to have an 'interesting experience'. Ms Figueroa did not hear from her son again, and was knew that he was in the blast when she saw that his debit card had been used at the restaurant right before the explosion. After spending a long night at a nearby school hoping that her son would be found in the wreckage, Mrs Figueroa was later shown the place where he died. While the family may worry that officials will forget about their son's death, she is grateful for public support. Visitors to the Second Avenue memorial can now read testaments to the loving brother and son and see the spot where the explosion took his life, which the family has marked with white roses. The family was shown the spot where their son died and planted white roses in memory of the 23-year-old . The recent Buffalo State College graduate had texted his mother saying that he was going on an 'interesting experience' before his blind date . The sidewalk near the site on Second Avenue had been closed to pedestrians for weeks following the blast before reopening .",

        "input": "Crime gangs from Eastern Europe are operating here with 'impunity' due to EU free movement rules, a disturbing report warns today. Human traffickers run huge benefit frauds in the UK, including one that was used to fund a housing development in Slovakia. The vile trade also includes the sale of young girls for prostitution and sham marriages. In some cases, 'customers' from outside the EU are requesting women with EU passports so they can make them pregnant. The migrants \u2013 desperate for a foothold in Britain \u2013 then claim they have a human right to a family life in the UK to raise the child. Vicious: A menacing Eastern European gang leader with his Rottweiler.\u00a0Crime gangs from Eastern Europe are operating here with 'impunity' due to EU free movement rules, a disturbing report warns today . The Centre for Social Justice report, written by a former senior aide to Home Secretary Theresa May, is based on interviews with senior police and officials in Britain and overseas. It offers a deeply disturbing insight into how, since the EU expanded to include former Eastern Bloc members in 2004, a huge market has opened up in what it calls the 'modern slave trade'. In the past, trafficking gangs had to bring in migrants from outside the EU \u2013 which meant they would need to pass through border controls. But they are now able to target people in impoverished communities in Slovakia, Poland, Romania and Bulgaria with open access to Britain. Migrants are duped into believing they are travelling to the UK for work and enter the country legally under the EU's Free Movement Directive. The traffickers then seize control of their bank accounts and travel documents, and force them to work in often gruesome conditions. The report, written by former Home Office special adviser Fiona Cunningham, says: 'One of the most serious unintended consequences of free movement in the EU is that it has made it much easier for organised criminal gangs to operate their cross-border business models with impunity and without fear of being detected and therefore pursued.' Significantly, the report has the backing of Mrs May, who has written the foreword. She has been one of the Cabinet ministers pushing for curbs on EU free movement \u2013 including restrictions on countries whose level of wealth is far below that of Britain. Limits: Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured, has been one of the Cabinet ministers pushing for curbs on EU free movement \u2013 including restrictions on countries whose level of wealth is far below that of Britain . The report also warns of Eastern European girls \u2013 aged 15 to 25 \u2013 being brought to Britain and forced into prostitution, benefit fraud or sham weddings to Asian men seeking a right to remain in the UK. Manchester, Birmingham and Gretna are identified as hotspots \u2013 with Scotland targeted so the victims can marry at a younger age. Shockingly, the report found girls were sold to 'customers' for pregnancy so the buyer could claim he had an article 8 right to a family life in the UK. Europol, the EU's crime fighting agency, has identified particular problems with children being brought into the UK from Slovakia. Voters want the Tories to be far tougher on mass immigration, a major survey revealed last night. Barely one in ten Britons say they are satisfied with David Cameron\u2019s border policies. The poll by Ipsos MORI suggests this unhappiness may explain why large numbers of Conservatives are switching to Ukip. The findings will heap pressure on the Prime Minister to end his silence on immigration during the election campaign.\u00a0He has not mentioned his party\u2019s manifesto pledges to curb EU free movement, deport more illegals and tag foreign criminals. Yet a large proportion of voters believe politicians are talking too little about migration. Blow for Cameron: A new Ipsos MORI survey reveals the huge levels of dissatisfaction with the Government's handing of immigration, especially among former Tory supporters who now plan to vote Ukip . Major issue: Just 12 per cent of all voters are satisfied with the handling of immigration, falling to just 1 per cent of Ukip supporters. Above, charts based on results from the Ipsos MORI survey . They are kept under the influence of drink and drugs, to make them easier to control, then sold for sex. Police in Kent said that, in a single day, 16 such children were taken into care. The report adds: 'Pregnant women are sometimes recruited and forced to sell their babies.' Action: Mr Cameron has also pledged to crack down on abuse of the benefits system by EU nationals . Romania and Hungry were also identified as countries from which criminal gangs are trafficking women for sex. Women who are brought to the UK and forced to work in the sex industry are often moved from city to city, with their services advertised online. One website featured 1,000 women based in London. The report calls on the EU to implement a new system of passenger name records so there is a better chance of tracking people smugglers and their victims who travel by air. But this is being blocked by the EU on privacy grounds. It would also alert the authorities if a suspected people smuggler was headed towards the UK with a child. The report says: 'Exploiting the internet and borders made less defined due to European Union policies like free movement, organised crime groups find the trafficking of victims a highly lucrative and accessible crime.' The Home Office has estimated that, in any given year, there are between 10,000 and 13,000 victims of human trafficking in the UK. In the last Parliament, the Tories passed Europe's first Modern Slavery Act. Traffickers involved in the most serious cases now face possible life sentences. David Cameron has also pledged to crack down on abuse of the benefits system by EU nationals. In November 2013, he announced new rules stipulating that incomers can receive out-of-work benefits only once they have been living in the country for three months. UK benefits scam builds a Slovak village . By Ian Drury, Home Affairs Correspondent for the Daily Mail . A crime gang from Slovakia duped unsuspecting families into travelling to the UK so they could scam hundreds of thousands of pounds in benefits \u2013 and send the cash back to a village known as 'Smartie Town'. The profits were funnelled to the 1,000-year-old village of Pavlovce nad Uhom in the Michalove district of Slovakia where they were used to build houses. The homes are partly funded by the UK taxpayer and local residents have nicknamed them 'Smarties' after the chocolate sweets because the houses are painted brightly and in different colours. Vivid: A house in so-called Smartie Town, where a crime gang funnelled profits from a benefits scam. Homes in the 1,000-year-old village, such as the one pictured above, are partly funded by the UK taxpayer . When the gang feared UK officials might become suspicious, they changed tactics \u2013 sending the migrants to Canada instead to claim asylum and state support there. The victims, expecting to work legally, had been transported to Britain in coaches. But once they were across the border, the criminals seized their passports and other documents and forced them into domestic servitude, slave labour and welfare fraud \u2013 signing up for several state handouts including tax credits. Gang members arranged housing and took their victims to open high street bank accounts using a 'translator' who was also in on the lucrative scam. Benefits were then paid into accounts in the names of the victims but controlled by the traffickers. Scam: Three Slovakian crooks, including Darina Balogova, pictured, raked in \u00a31.2million by bringing 'fake mothers' to Britain to claim benefits falsely . The sums of money made by the Eastern Europeans from trafficking victims using this kind of exploitation were huge. In another case, three Slovakian con artists raked in \u00a31.2million by bringing 'fake mothers' to Britain to claim benefits falsely. They persuaded women from their home country to live in the UK and fraudulently claim child and working tax benefits. The family splashed the vast amounts of cash they pocketed on a life of luxury, gambling in casinos and going on spending sprees to buy gold and diamonds. The crooks \u2013 Darina Balogova, her husband Marek Balog, and brother Jaroslav Bado \u2013 pulled off one of the largest welfare scams of its kind from a terraced house in Chatham, Kent. Up to 50 women were brought to Britain under freedom of movement rules and groomed to claim falsely that they were working for a temp agency on low wages so they could receive tax credits. After the gang had exploited the identities of the women, they allowed them to return to Slovakia, retaining control of their bank accounts, passports, national insurance cards and birth certificates. Balogova \u2013 who never worked a day after arriving in Britain \u2013 kept around \u00a330,000 in cash at their headquarters in nearby Rochester. At least \u00a360,000 in stolen benefits were transferred back home. But the scam was finally exposed when the criminals began using a high street stationer's receipt books to write bogus payslips for the women. HM Revenue & Customs inspectors noticed they were using the same employee number on all the slips. In November 2011, at Maidstone Crown Court the gang were jailed for tax credit fraud and money laundering. Balogova was sentenced to four-and-a-half years, while Balog was given three-and-a-half years and Bado three years.

School cleaner Vincent Stanford, who moved to Leeton  from Holland over a year ago with his mother and brother, was charged with Ms Scott's murder on Thursday.

Mark Lowe, 32, from Skelmersdale, Lancashire, is currently serving a five-year sentence for beating and kicking his brother Wayne to death, after Wayne, then 33, attacked him in his bed with a knife. Mark's wife Sarah is now looking after three young children alone and said: '[Mark] will regret what he did for the rest of his life, because he loved his brother.' Mark Lowe, 32 (left), is currently serving a five year sentence for beating and kicking his brother Wayne (right) to death, but his wife Sarah (bottom) is standing by her man . Mark appeared before Liverpool Crown Court Court earlier this year. The court heard that Mark had killed his brother after Wayne tried to stab him during a drink-fuelled day of fighting at his mum's house on September 7 last year. Mark then kicked Wayne, 33, to death and was charged with his murder. But prosecutors accepted a manslaughter plea 'on the basis of a loss of control' as he was first attacked by a knife-wielding Wayne. Mark pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was last month jailed for five years. Sarah said: 'What Mark did was wrong. Wayne's death has shattered our whole family.

Mark and Wayne, pictured as children, were said to be close, but Wayne had a dangerous temper and it was usually Mark who would 'calm him down' and act as peacemaker . 'Of the two brothers, Mark was always the peacemaker, stepping in to calm Wayne down. I always feared that Wayne would be the one to hurt him - not the other way round. 'It was said in court that Wayne had even attacked his own mother. He was well-known to the police and he had attacked officers too. 'But on that occasion, for the first time, Mark fought back, and he snapped. But I have to stand by him. Mark is a nurse and a good man and a loving father.' Mark and Sarah, both mental health nurses, met in 2004, working in a nursing home. Sarah said: 'We were both seeing other people but there was a spark between us that we couldn't ignore. 'Mark was a big football fan, a real man's man, but he had a heart of gold and was very compassionate. 'My dad was ill with cancer, and Mark and I both looked after him until he died.

He trained as a nurse. He was also a keen runner and played the cornet in an orchestra. 'Wayne was a hot-head, in and out of work as a painter and decorator and often in fights. They had a lot of run-ins and Mark was frightened of him sometimes.' Sarah and Mark were married in October 2006 and went on to have three children, Jessica, now seven, Jocelyn, now three and one-year-old Jaiden. As they settled down to family life, Sarah often witnessed Wayne's erratic and aggressive behaviour. Sarah said: 'Wayne was a troubled soul; he got into trouble, often fighting when he was drinking too much. 'There were occasions when he was violent to their mum, Jill, and Mark had to go round to calm him down. 'Mark was the peacemaker whenever Wayne flew into a temper. Mark had mental health training, which helped, but they also had a bond as brothers.' Wayne (left) was described by the prosecution as 'a violent woman-beater well-known to the police' and once attacked his mum (right), leaving her with broken ribs . Sarah and Mark were married in October 2006 (pictured), and as they settled down to family life, Sarah often witnessed Wayne's erratic and aggressive behaviour . Wayne received professional help for his behaviour but his problems continued. Sarah said: 'When he wasn't drinking, he was a very charming, charismatic man, and we got on well. But I was wary of his temper. 'Mark was too soft and would always give him a second chance, which caused rows between us. But I thought Wayne was dangerous.' In September 2014, Sarah and Mark rowed and he went to stay overnight with his mum. Sarah said: 'I spoke to Mark in the evening, and we had both calmed down by then. He said be would home very early in the morning to take Jessica to school for her first day in the juniors.' But at midnight, Sarah was awoken by police at her door to tell her that Wayne was dead. Hours later, Mark called her to say he had been arrested for murdering his brother. Sarah said: 'That whole night was like a dream. It didn't seem real. Mark was very shaken when he called me, but he was adamant, from the start, that he didn't mean to hurt him and I knew that was true. 'I was devastated. I had always feared that Wayne might hurt Mark - not the other way round. I supported Mark completely.' Mark (left) had no previous convictions and said he and his family were bullied by his brother all his life. Pictured (right) Sarah with Jaiden . At the trial, the judge said Mark (pictured) was remorseful and 'genuinely devastated' by the death of his brother and what he had done to his family . At first, Sarah was supported by Mark's mum, but after he was charged with murder, they became distant. She said: 'I felt as though they were blaming me. And it went round and round my head, that if I hadn't rowed with Mark, he wouldn't have gone to his mum's and Wayne would still be alive. 'Our lives were in turmoil. Our three children missed their dad so much. 'Mark had never been in trouble before in his life, so to be sent away on remand was horrific for him. He was terrified.' John McDermott, prosecuting, said: 'The killing of Wayne Lowe was the final act in a day of arguments and fighting between the brothers, who when sober seemed to get on together, but when in drink were both prone to bad behaviour, according to their mother.' Mr McDermott said Wayne was a violent woman-beater 'well-known to the police' and once attacked his mum, leaving her with broken ribs. He had also head-butted a police officer and was described by his mother as 'a man who would fight to the end'. Mark had no previous convictions and said he and his family were bullied by his brother all his life. He said he suffered traumatic amnesia and did not remember the final moments, but had gone to sleep only to wake with a 'completely mad' Wayne lashing at him with a knife. Sarah, who is raising thier children alone, said, 'I had always feared that Wayne might hurt Mark - not the other way round. I supported Mark completely' Arthur Gibson, defending, said it was a tragedy sparked by Wayne, 'a Jekyll and Hyde character' who when drunk 'would pick an argument and fight even his friends'. Mr Gibson said the injuries Wayne suffered in the first fight were 'lawfully inflicted' and Mark had tried to avoid more violence. He said Mark had defended himself in the second fight, but when his brother presented no further threat, 'lost control'. Mr Gibson said: 'He accepts he must have struck and kicked his brother a considerable number of times, when his brother was unable to defend himself.' But he added: 'The trigger here is a man asleep in bed, being attacked by another man with a knife. 'It is difficult to see how there could be a greater degree of provocation.' Mr Justice King said Mark unleashed a 'frenzied' attack on his brother and said it was not true that he had acted only in self-defence and bore no responsibility. Jailing him for four years and eight months, the judge said Mark was remorseful and 'genuinely devastated' by the death of his brother and what he had done to his family. Sarah has now started a support group for Mark, which has 150 members.",

        "input": "The time is around 9pm on a Thursday and 7,000 people are chanting \u2018YES! YES! YES!\u2019 in a pitch-black car park in London\u2019s Docklands. It\u2019s been raining and the ground is damp, but we are all in our bare feet, which are going numb on the cold, hard concrete. Undeterred, we keep going. There\u2019s a drum pounding in the distance and we keep step with its beat. Marianne Power attended Robbins\u2019 Unleash The Power Within seminarwhich claims to\u00a0\u2018discover how to identify what it is you really want' The mood is tribal. I feel as if we\u2019re on our way to a ritual killing. Maybe our own. We\u2019ve already signed waivers warning us that what we are about to take part in could result in \u2018physical or emotional injury, paralysis, death . . .\u2019 and we\u2019ve spent the past half-an-hour being told what we need to do to avoid hospitalisation. I feel sick with anticipation, but there\u2019s no way out \u2014 the huge crowd keeps pushing me forward. Then, the chanting stops and a hush fills the air. We are faced with our fate. It glimmers grey and red in the darkness: lanes of burning hot coals, which we are to walk over. Yes, actually walk over \u2014 with our bare feet. We have spent the past two hours preparing for this moment \u2014 being whipped into something called \u2018peak state\u2019, a place where you are so mentally strong that you can do anything. The idea is that, once you overcome the fear of walking on coals of between 1,200 and 2,000 Fahrenheit, you can \u2018conquer the other fires of your life with ease\u2019. But I don\u2019t conquer anything with ease. It\u2019s not in my nature. \u2018Am I really doing this?\u2019 is all I can think. But yes, I am. For the past year, I\u2019ve been on a self-improvement mission. Fed up with a life spent worrying, single and broke, I\u2019ve set myself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self-help guru each month. Marianne (pictured) has\u00a0set herself a bizarre challenge to live by the rules of a different self-help guru each month and this month she chose that of Anthony Robbins . And, when it comes to the self-improvement world, Anthony Robbins is the king. Everyone from world leaders \u2014 Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev \u2014 to athletes such as Serena Williams and actors including Hugh Jackman seek his counsel. He even helped Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher. His IS a classic rags-to-riches story. Determined to transcend his poor childhood, he became obsessed with self-improvement. He\u2019d listen to motivational tapes on his way to his job as a janitor, before going on to give motivational talks himself. Fast forward to today and he is a bestselling author and hugely successful business man, whose net worth is in the region of half a billion dollars. He charges $1 million to coach private clients \u2014 which is why the rest of us have to settle for listening to him in a concert hall. Anthony Robbins (pictured in the 1990s) charges\u00a0$1 million to coach private clients and is the 'king' of the\u00a0self-improvement world . According to his website, Robbins\u2019 Unleash The Power Within seminar would help me \u2018discover how to identify what it is you really want, break through any barriers that might be holding you back, increase your energy and mental clarity, and infuse passion into your life\u2019. Big promises. But the fortysomething woman next to me in the queue to get in promises that he can deliver. She has been three times before, she tells me. \u2018When you walk over those coals, something changes,\u2019 she says, her eyes wide. \u2018I can\u2019t explain it, but it\u2019s just amazing.\u2019 She has all the fervour of a fanatic. Two physiotherapists from Windsor join in our conversation \u2014 they\u2019ve been sent here by their boss. \u2018He went last year and got a lot out of it,\u2019 they say. \u2018He was on a high for weeks.\u2019 And \u2018high\u2019 is the perfect word for the atmosphere. As we file into the arena, there\u2019s chaos as people rush to get good seats \u2014 but no one sits in them. They\u2019re too busy dancing along with the music blasting from the speakers. It\u2019s like being at a One Direction concert. After half-an-hour, Tony walks on stage and the screaming goes off the scale. People can hardly contain themselves in the presence of the 6 ft 7 in mountain of a man. With his Hollywood tan, white teeth and lantern jaw, he looks like something that a Mills & Boon writer would dream up. And just to add to the effect, his chiselled face is blown up to God-like proportions on massive screens behind him. It takes minutes for the applause to die down enough for him to speak \u2014 but when he starts, he doesn\u2019t stop. His basic message is that anything is possible if we just get our minds and bodies into what he calls the peak state. He says we are all defined by our limiting beliefs and that if we get rid of these then \u2018the impossible just gets done\u2019. He is the King of the Catchphrase: \u2018It\u2019s impossible to love yourself when you\u2019re not being yourself\u2019; \u2018Change your story, change your life . . .\u2019 These nuggets come out of his mouth from 1pm to 9pm. He doesn\u2019t take a tea break and neither do we. It\u2019s extraordinary \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Just the sheer energy of him. I find myself thinking that he is the living embodiment of human potential, then I realise I\u2019m swooning. Even world leaders like Nelson Mandela (left) and Bill Clinton (right) have sought the advice and counsel of Anthony Robbins . I turn to the Norwegian man next to me and say: \u2018I think I\u2019m in love . . .\u2019 He smiles and says: \u2018Me, too.\u2019 We are all under his spell and will do anything he says, including hugging and high-fiving strangers, and punching our fists in the air while yelling: \u2018Yes, yes, yes!\u2019 It\u2019s just so un-English. There are moments when I look around at the collective madness and feel as if I\u2019ve become part of a cult, but I have to make a decision: get embarrassed or go with it. I go with it. As the day goes on, we examine our \u2018limiting beliefs\u2019. I identify mine as being bad with money and always getting sick. And then he asks us to visualise what life would be like if we got rid of these limiting beliefs. I imagine being healthy, energetic and productive, someone who just gets things done without always worrying about the things that can go wrong. I imagine my bank account being in the black and owning a property. To build on this vision, we\u2019re taught how to get into a peak state by thinking of the best moment of our lives, the moment we felt strongest and most at peace. I think of times with loved ones and professional achievements that I\u2019m proud of. Each time we do we are told to \u2018make a move\u2019, so every time we make that move in the future, these memories will come back. I pump my fist in the air, again and again and again. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing it \u2014 it\u2019s so not me. I feel as if I\u2019m in the film Rocky. And then the time comes to walk on fire. We\u2019re told to take off our shoes and socks and march out of the conference centre to the 8 ft lines of coal in the car park. Robbins is said to have also helped well-known face including Princess Diana (left) and former prime minister, Margaret Thatcher (right) A part of me wants to run away, but a bigger part of me knows that I can do this. Then I\u2019m standing in front of the coals and two men are instructing me to shout: \u2018YES!\u2019 I do. They say \u2018Make your move!\u2019 and I pump my fist in the air. Then, I go for it. I put my foot on the coals and after that I remember nothing \u2014 until my last step, when I could feel heat. I have half-a-second of panic when I realise what I\u2019m doing \u2014 but, by then, my feet are on the cold square of grass put at the end of the fire and my feet are being hosed down by helpers. It\u2019s done. I\u2019ve walked across a bed of hot coals. Two weeks later, I still cannot answer those questions, but I find myself having the same thoughts as the woman I met in the queue at the start of that day. That strange moment of collective hysteria, when we walked over hot coals, has changed something within me. If I can walk on fire without barbecuing my feet, what else can I do? I\u2019m very keen to find out. To follow Marianne\u2019s self-help journey, go to helpmeblog.net .",

        "input": "The funeral of South Carolina police shooting victim Walter Scott took on a fiery tone today when the pastor presiding over the service said his death was 'motivated by racial discrimination'. Dr George Hamilton, the Chief Apostle of the W.O.R.D. Ministries in Summerville, South Carolina, launched an attack on officer Michael Slager, who killed Scott last week by shooting him five times in the back, referring to him as a 'disgrace'. Hundreds of mourners were crammed inside the small church today, where Scott's casket, draped in an American flag, was led in, accompanied by his distraught mother. The family had a police escort to the funeral. Hamilton continued to rail against Slager, who has been jailed and charged with Scott's murder, during the service. Referring to the cell phone video which shows Scott being gunned down as he tried to run from Slager, he said: 'It's one thing to have a loved one die... It's another to have to watch them die... and see how they died'. Scroll down for videos .

According to ABC News, he continued: 'Walter's death was motivated by racial discrimination. You've got to hate somebody to shoot them in the back. 'This officer is a disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department... You don't tase a man and then shoot him.A badge is not authority to murder.' Hamilton did add that Slager's actions were not representative of all law enforcement, insisting 'We will not indict the entire law enforcement for the act of one racist'. Judy Scott, Walter's mother, was among the hundreds of mourners at the service today, arriving with other family members in a fleet of black limousines to the service for Scott, 50, who was a father of four. Scott, a former coast guard, had been married twice and was engaged to be married to a third woman before he was pulled over for a broken tail light by Slager, who shot him five times in the back after a confrontation in North Charleston. So many people came to the service that hundreds were left waiting outside.\u00a0U.S. senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman Jim Clyburn (D-SC), state senator Marlon Kimpson, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, and Elder James Johnson of the National Action Network all attended. After the funeral\u00a0Rep. Clyburn, said he wanted national strategies and standards for law enforcement to be considered. Referring to the suggestion that officers be made to wear body-mounted cameras, he said: 'Body cameras are a good start. They're certainly not a panacea'. In an obituary Scott's family focused on his love for his friends and family, devotion to God, and appreciation for the Dallas Cowboys. At a wake yesterday his casket had also been adorned with Cowboys memorabilia. The obituary said: 'Walter was born in February 9, 1965 native of Charleston, SC area. He attended the Charleston County School System. He proudly served his country by enlisting in the National Coast Guard in 1984 where he was stationed in Baltimore, Maryland. 'He received his massage therapist degree from Miller Motte in 2006. He leaves to mourn loving parents, Elder Walter and Minister Judy G Scott, two brothers Anthony N. Scott and Rodney E.

'Walter loved the Lord; and he expressed it by singing in the choir. He loved all of his family and friends and often embraced others as family. He was a true fan of the Dallas Cowboys.' Scott worked as a forklift truck driver and had served in the Coast Guard in the 1980s. Police escorted a hearse headed towards W.O.R.D. Ministries in Summerville, South Carolina. Mourners waited through light rain as flowers were unloaded and taken to the sanctuary. His family, with a police escort, arrived at the church around 11am in a fleet of three black limousines. Dozens of mourners who were lined up outside the church held up their cellphones trying to capture the scene as Scott's casket was unloaded from the hearse and wheeled into the church.

Tributes: Men carry flowers into the church where Scott's service is being held today. An obituary praised his loving nature and generosity towards family and friends . Sadness: Mourners in Summerville leaned on one another ahead of the service for Scott, who has four children aged 16-24 . The family said they decided to keep the press away after the New York Daily News reported that they had banned Al Sharpton from the funeral - a claim the family and Sharpton have refuted. A wake for Scott was held yesterday, at which his open casket was on display and adorned with Dallas Cowboys memorabilia. At the time he was stopped, Scott owed some $18,000 in child support payments, which family said may have been why he tried to run from Slager. His brother, Rodney Scott, said: 'He had trouble keeping up with the payments, that's all, and he knew he would go to jail. 'His mission was to avoid the police as much as possible.' Dash cam video from Slager's patrol car has shown him pulling over Scott, who got out of his car and ran while the officer's back was turned. Court records show Scott last paid child support in 2012 and a bench warrant for his arrest was issued in early 2013. Scott had been in jail three times since 2008. Rodney Scott said his brother would take long detours while driving to their parents' house because he thought there were more police patrolling the direct, 10-minute route from his home. He said Walter also tried to make sure any vehicle he drove had working headlights and taillights. Some of the city's black residents have told similar stories about being stopped by police over minor infractions or simply avoiding police altogether.

Scott was in the Coast Guard for two years, and is pictured left in uniform. Slager is being held in jail on murder charges, and is pictured right in his prison mugshot . It emerged yesterday that Scott had also been jailed in 1987 on a charge of assault and battery. A report released by the Charleston County Sheriff's Department on Friday said they had to break up a fight between Scott and another man, during which he shoved a deputy to the floor. Despite Scott's record, those who knew him remember Scott as lighthearted and gentle. They describe a laid-back, fun-loving man who took his girlfriend dancing on weekends, entertained family and friends with backyard cookouts and hosted regular domino games. 'This is a long time coming, but now that it has come all of those things have to be recognized. It's so sad that it happened like that because a lot of this stuff has been on the backburner for a long time,' Ernest Murray, 73, said during Scott's wake. 'He wouldn't hurt a fly, man,' said Ronald Smith, 29, a co-worker who often got advice on marriage and other life decisions from Scott when the older man gave him a lift home after their shift. 'All of us looked up to him.'",

        "input": "When keen runner Julie Creffield was training for a marathon when she was a size 18, she was often heckled with taunts of 'Oi, fatty!' as she ran. Even her doctor told her she was too big to contemplate running 26.2 miles and should give up on her goal. With stories like this, it is perhaps no surprise that a new survey has found two thirds of women believe they can't run - despite being desperate to be fitter and healthier. Scroll down for video . When she was a size 18, Julie was told she was too fat to run but she completed a marathon, left, and has done numerous races since, including one at the London 2012 Olympic park, right . Julie, 37, from Stratford in East London, didn't let her critics stop her from running. She completed a marathon in 2012 - and has done numerous other races since. Now through her website, The Fat Girl's Guide To Running, she's encouraging other women to take up the sport regardless of their size and ability. She appeared on today's This Morning with sub-three hour marathoner Nell McAndrew to launch the ITV show's Run For Your Life campaign. Julie said: 'Two million more men than women in the UK play sport because women are often too worried about what they look like and fear they will be judged by others, this has to stop. 'Run For Your Life will show that anyone can find success with running, and show that women of all shapes and sizes that running can be fun and can be a great way of improving physical and mental health. And if enough women get involved and give it a go, we can really start tackling negative perceptions in our own communities. 'I was told by a doctor I was too fat to run, and just three weeks later I proved him wrong by running the Brighton Marathon, but you don't have to be able to run far or even fast to benefit from the joys of running, its all about taking part and being inspired\u2026even if you are still a little bit rubbish at it.' Julie, back right, appeared on today's This Morning with Nell McAndrew, back left, to encourage women to take up running. Front row from left: Francesca, Kerrie and Shirley are taking up the challenge . Marathon runner Nell McAndrew encouraged the women to believe in themselves . Nell, whose Guide To Running book was published by Bloomsbury this month, added: 'Break down that barrier of being embarrassed and you will meet like-minded people in the running community. 'There's lots of support on Twitter with groups such as UK Run Chat. 'When you start running, your confidence will soon grow. I just used to go to local park and could only manage short distances but I gradually built it up. Doing races is real confidence booster so\u00a0believe in yourself as you can do it.' A This Morning poll of 1000 women found that 60 per cent think they can't run yet 88 per cent would like to be fitter than they are. Seventy per cent haven't been for a run in the last year but more than 75 per cent plan on getting fitter this year. Many women are put off running because they fear they are not fit enough and are self-conscious about being seen sweating and panting while out on a jog. Julie loves running and has never let her size hold her back. She encourages other women to do the same . Others believe their size is holding them back so they don't bother - even though by taking up the sport they could lose weight. The This Morning project, like the recently launched 'This Girl Can' Sport England campaign, aims to show women they can run - even if they are currently unfit and overweight. The show will follow three novice runners - Shirley Hargan-Kennedy, 38, from Glasgow, Francesca Kennedy, 23, from Redditch, and Kerrie Jones, 37, from Cannock, Staffs -\u00a0as they train for five weeks to run 5K. The show is encouraging viewers to join them on the journey by taking up running themselves. The three women revealed they currently fall into the camp of not believing they can run but want to give it a go to improve their health and wellbeing. Phillip Schofield hands out new trainers to the three woman sat on the sofa who believe they can't run but have agreed to try a five week programme culminating in a 5k race . Francesca said: 'I've tried running up and down my close and I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.' Shirley said she wants to become like the runners she sees out training enjoying the exercise and taking in the scenic countryside when they run off-road. Overweight Kerry explained that her motivation is to partly aid weightloss, as well as to set a good example to her children. She said: 'I know I have always been fat but finding out I'm now classed as clinically obese is scary. 'I need to do this for my children, it's not about dress size anymore it's about health. Society is more accepting of big woman now but for health that's not good. 'What I hope to get from this is a new me so I'm not the fat mum at the school gates.' Julie knows how Kerry feels as she weighed 20st when she first started running in 2003. Now she is slimmer and fitter but she explains women have so much more to gain from taking up running than just weightloss. Nell looked the part as she arrived at the ITV studios in her running leggings and trainers . She said: 'I'm not a size 8 and if I can do it, so can you. Woman who take up running will come to realise it's fun and then they will want to do it more. We often hate running as it hurts but you can find ways to enjoy it. 'You have to build up gradually stop letting excuses like having bad knees or a bad back or no sports bra stopping you getting out the door. Get out and start walking then build up to running and you will see the health improvements.' Julia advised anyone who is concerned about taking up running to speak to their doctor first. To avoid injury, she also recommends wearing supportive trainers, starting slowly and stretching after running. One of the reasons many people avoid running is a fear that it's bad for their knees. But a study of 75,000 runners, which was published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise last year, found that 'running significantly reduced osteoarthritis and hip replacement risk due to, in part, running's association with lower BMI (Body Mass Index)'. Nell McAndrew finishing the 2012 London Marathon . 1. Invest in a good pair of trainers and some seam-free running socks. You are best going to a specialist shop for this as they will assess your running gait (or style) to find the appropriate pair. It's the only big investment you have to make and it's so important that your feet are comfortable. 2. Buy a good sports bra. Aside from running shoes, this is the other essential for women. 3. Team up with a friend so that you can support and motivate each other. If you have arranged to meet someone you'll be less likely to back out. Running with someone else also helps the minutes tick by as you have a good gossip. Alternatively look for a beginner's group or couch to 5km scheme in your area (runengland.org is a great place to start). 4. Make steady progress. If you haven't run before, download a couch to 5km programme or app (there are plenty available for free) as they advocate lots of walking and running to start with. Build up gradually, increasing your running duration by no more than 10 per cent every week. 5. Have a plan. We women are all so busy and I find it helps to sit down at the start of the week and think about what I have on each day so that I can plan when to fit in a run. It's amazing how it slots into your routine - I've jogged to school to pick up my son with my daughter in the pushchair and then jogged back as he scoots or cycles along with us. Make it work for you. 6. Log your progress. Psychologists have proven that keeping a record of your running achievements helps to spur you on. So write everything down in a diary and flick back through it when you need a boost. 7. Enter a race. OK, this is not as daunting as it sounds, I recommend everyone tries a parkrun (parkrun.org.uk) after about 5-6 weeks of running regularly. These free 5km events are held weekly at around 300 parks in the UK. 8. Be competitive. This doesn't mean you are aiming to win Olympic medals or set a record for your age group. But making targets for yourself can keep you going. It might be that you set a goal of running 5km after 6 weeks or finishing ahead of a certain person in training. It all helps hugely with motivation. 9. Eat well. One of the things I love about running regularly is that I can stay in shape without having to stick to a strict diet that forbids the eating of certain food groups. In my modelling days, the girls who were on no-carb, or no-fat diets always seemed so miserable. And sports scientists all agree that a moderate amount of carbs are essential for running. 10. Remember why you run. Maybe it's to lose weight, to raise money for charity or to de-stress. Whatever the reason, don't lose sight of it. That way when that little voice inside your head tries to stop you from heading out on a run to stay on the sofa with chocolate instead, you will overcome it. Running will empower you in a million ways. Run first and eat your chocolate afterwards (chocolate milk is proven to be a great recovery drink).

        "input": "Ten deputies have been placed on leave\u00a0after a shocking video emerged showing them punching and kicking an alleged horse\u00a0thief\u00a0for two minutes following a chase through the California desert. In the video, captured by an\u00a0NBC\u00a0helicopter, Francis Pusok, 30, is\u00a0seen falling off the horse he was suspected of stealing after being pursued several miles by the San Bernardino County officers. Seconds later, two deputies catch up to Pusok and stun him with their Tasers. They then stun him again, and again, as lies splayed face-down on the ground, with his arms placed behind his back. As the camera keeps rolling, the officers apparently kick the suspect in the head and crotch, before other deputies arrive on the scene. One clearly draws back his leg and swings it at Pusok's head. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shocking: Ten deputies have been placed on leave after a horrific video emerged showing them punching and kicking (left) alleged horse thief Francis Pusok (right) following a chase through the southern California desert . Beating: In the video, captured by an NBC helicopter, Pusok, 30, is seen falling off the horse he was suspected of stealing. Seconds later, the deputies catch up to him and stun him with a Taser, before beating him (above) Chillingly, after the beating, a deputy whispered in the suspect's ear: 'This isn't over,' according to Pusok's attorney Jim Terrell, who said the man was left 'scared to death for himself and his family'. Now, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon has placed 10 deputies on paid administrative leave for their alleged roles in the graphic footage, which he said had 'disturbed and troubled him'. McMahon said the video, captured on Thursday, appeared to show an excessive use of force. He added that he was launching an internal investigation into the actions of the unidentified officers. 'I'm not sure if there was a struggle with the suspect,' he told NBC. 'It appears there was in the early parts of the video. What happens afterwards, I'm not sure of, but we will investigate it thoroughly.' In a tweet via the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office, McMahon said: 'We have identified 10 deputies involved in the use of force during the arrest & they have been placed on paid admin leave.' Earlier on Thursday, Pusok had allegedly fled by car after deputies had tried to serve a search warrant in an identity-theft investigation. He later dumped the vehicle in the Hesperia area, it is said. Investigation: San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon (pictured) said the video, captured on Thursday, appeared to show an excessive use of force. He added that he was launching an internal investigation . Paid leave: In a tweet via the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office (pictured), McMahon said: 'We have identified 10 deputies involved in the use of force during the arrest & they have been placed on paid admin leave' Couple: Pusok's girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner (left), said her boyfriend (right) has had several run-ins with the law. However, she insisted he is a great father, and said she 'couldn't believe' the filmed attack . The suspect, dressed in bright red clothing, then reportedly stole a horse and made his way across the desert near the town of Apple Valley, east of LA, before being tracked down by deputies. In the video, Pusok can be seen falling from the horse as a deputy runs up and uses a stun gun on him. McMahon said the stun gun was believed to be ineffective because of the man's loose clothing. The suspect then falls face down with his arms and legs outstretched and put his hands behind his back. The video shows two deputies appearing to come up and kick him in the head and crotch. As more officers join in, the men huddle in a pack over Pusok, continuing to pummel their fists and feet into his back and head.\u00a0Meanwhile, one deputy stands calmly holding the horse by the saddle. Following the incident, two deputies were taken to a nearby hospital for injuries, including abrasions, a twisted knee and a back injury from being struck by the horse, the sheriff's office said. Chase: The suspect, dressed in bright red clothing,  reportedly stole a horse and made his way across the desert near the town of Apple Valley, east of LA, on Thursday, before being tracked down by deputies . Apprehended: In the video, Pusok can be seen falling from the horse as a deputy runs up and uses a stun gun on him. McMahon said the stun gun was believed to be ineffective because of the man's loose clothing . Pusok was treated at the hospital for abrasions and bruising. He was then released to be booked on suspicion of felony evading, theft of a horse, possession of stolen property and reckless driving. After the video was broadcast by NBC, it sparked outrage on the Internet, with many users noting that Pusok was lying on the ground in a 'surrender' position when he was beaten by the officers. On Friday, Mr Terrell told KABC\u00a0that the attack seemed never-ending.\u00a0'This is as bad, if not worse, than what they did to Rodney King. This was terrible. It kept going and going and going,' he said. Rodney King, who died in 2012, rose to national fame after he was captured on video being beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers following a high-speed car chase in March 1991. Although four officers were charged with assault with a deadly weapon and use of excessive force, they were later acquitted in a series of verdicts that are thought to have caused the 1992 LA riots. 'Surrendering': The suspect then falls face down with his arms and legs outstretched and put his hands behind his back. The video shows two deputies appearing to come up and kick him in the head and crotch . Huddled around: As more officers join in, the men huddle in a pack over Pusok, continuing to pummel their fists and feet into his back and head. Meanwhile, one deputy stands calmly holding the horse by the saddle. Also Friday, McMahon said an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies' actions in the arrest of Pusok. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. 'I'm asking for some patience while we complete a thorough and fair investigation,' McMahon said. 'I am disturbed and troubled by what I see in the video. It does not appear to be in line with our policies and procedures. Hospitalized: Pusok (pictured) was treated at a nearby hospital for abrasions and bruising . 'I assure you, if there is criminal doing on the part of any of our deputy sheriffs or any policy violations we will take action.' The deputies were wearing audio recorders, but McMahon said he had not listened to them and the recordings will be part of the investigation. Attorneys for Pusok told KNBC-TV Friday as they left the jail that their client has a badly swollen eye, marks from the beating over his face and body, and is in pain. 'He remembers being beat, and he remembers that he wasn't resisting, that he laid still, he complied immediately. He says that he didn't even move a muscle because he didn't want to be continuously beat, yet it still happened,' said attorney Sharon Brunner. Ken Cooper, a use of force expert, said the deputies were clearly frustrated and appeared to take that out on the suspect. One, he said, appeared to be striking Pusok with the Taser. 'It doesn't look good. It looks like his hands are behind his back even when they're doing the blows,' Cooper said. 'The justification for using force is to gain compliance from the suspect, and the suspect seems to be complying. So what this looks like is those blows are not justified, they're not necessary and they're not professional.' Cooper said the officers should be disciplined, retrained to deal with stress especially, and the video should be used for department-wide training. He said the officers allowed their emotions and adrenaline to overtake their professionalism. But training helps 'inoculate' officers from responding improperly during high-stress situations. 'When chasing a fleeing suspect, in high stress, you have to control that. It's your obligation as a professional. You can lose it sometimes,' Cooper said. McMahon said deputies had previously been called to Pusok's home in Apple Valley, where he had allegedly made threats to kill a deputy and shot a puppy in front of family members. 'We were very familiar with his aggressive nature,' McMahon said. Comparison: On Friday, Pusok's attorney, Jim Terrell, told KABC that the attack was 'as bad, if not worse, than what they did to Rodney King'. King (left, after his beating) rose to national fame after he was captured on video being beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers (right) following a high-speed car chase in March 1991 . Pusok's beating came as recent violent episodes by officers dealing with suspects have hit the headlines, including the killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend. Scott, 50, who was unarmed, was shot dead by 33-year-old Officer Michael Slageras he ran away from him during a traffic stop. Slageras has since been arrested and charged with murder. Pusok's girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner, said her long-term boyfriend has had several run-ins with the law. However, she insisted that he is a great father who did not deserve the brutal beating. 'I'm not going to stand here and say that he's perfect, because who is?' she \u00a0said. 'I couldn't believe it,' Bindner said after seeing the video. 'The first thing I said was 'they cannot do that.'' The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement saying it is 'deeply troubled by the video images' and applauding McMahon's call for an investigation.",

Nicholas Figueroa's mother, Ana, was among more than 200 mourners to attend the funeral for her son, who was on a second date at a sushi restaurant in the city's East Village when he was killed. Carrying a red rose and wearing a button featuring her son's image, she wept as she watched his casket being loaded into a hearse outside the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus in Manhattan. Mr Figueroa's father, Nixon, who supported his wife throughout the funeral, told mourners: 'I'm here but I'm broken. My son is broken. My wife is broken. It hurts... It's heartbreaking for everybody.' Scroll down for video .

I appreciate everybody coming. I'm going to put my son to rest now.' Mr Figueroa, a former model and bowling lane employee, was settling the check for himself and his Bowlmor Lanes colleague at the Sushi Park restaurant in Second Ave. when the building exploded. He was declared missing following the terrifying incident, which gutted three buildings. But last week, his body was pulled from the building's rubble alongside that of 26-year-old busboy, Moises Locon. During Tuesday's service, mourners - including City Council Speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito - clung to each other and wept as heartfelt speeches were made and 'Ave Maria' rung through the church. Mr Figueroa's brother, Neal, paid tribute to his 'best friend', who had worked as\u00a0a camp counselor\u00a0at Manhattan's Asphalt Green sports facility. 'I want to be just like him,' he said, according to\u00a0NBC. He added: 'I can't wait to have my own little boy, he's going to have the same name: Nicholas.'

'I want to be just like him,' Neal told mourners . The emotionla funeral was held at the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus (pictured) in the Upper West Side . The Reverend Lawrence Ford praised Mr Figueroa for his selfless work as an Eagle Scout with the Boy Scouts, saying that his life had been 'cut too short,' according to the\u00a0New York Daily News. One Boy Scout at the funeral told CBS\u00a0the victim had shown 'devotion and leadership'. Meanwhile, Paul Culff of Asphalt Green, said Mr Figueroa had 'left an impression' with the facility's youngsters. Mr Figueroa's parents placed a white cloth over his brown casket as a symbol of his innocence. Inside the casket, their son was reportedly dressed in a blue shirt, a checkered tie and a navy vest. Following the service, a number of pallbearers - including Mr\u00a0Figueroa's father and his brother Neal - were pictured carrying his casket to a hearse in front of  loved ones, who were holding red roses. It was then placed in a hearse and driven away. In addition to Mr Figueroa and Mr Locon's fatal injuries, 22 more people were wounded in the five-story building explosion at 121 Second Avenue. Probe:\u00a0Mr Figueroa's parents placed a white cloth over his brown casket as a symbol of his innocence. Above, investigators work on the site on April 2 to determine whether charges should be brought over the explosion . Blaze: Firefighters battle the flames following the explosion at the East Village apartment block last month . Former model: Mr Figueroa (pictured left and right) was declared missing following the terrifying incident . Mr Figueroa's date, Teresa Galarce, 22, suffered a broken nose, a broken rib and a punctured lung. She is now recovering from her injuries. It is unknown whether she attended Tuesday's funeral. The explosion also caused fires at 119, 123 and 125 Second Avenue. All buildings apart from 125 ultimately crumbled to the ground, prompting an enormous response from emergency crews. Following the recovery of his body, Mr Figueroa's family had started raising money to help cover his funeral costs and other expenses via a GoFundMe page, which amassed more than $27,000. On Monday, it was reported that a plumber who worked on the building has accused the building's landlord's son of making him illegally tap a gas line ahead of the deadly blast on March 26. The unidentified plumber admitted that he illegally tapped a gas line before the explosion but said he only did so on the orders of the landlord's son, Michael Hrynenko Jr., the New York Post\u00a0reported. Another victim: Last week, Mr Figueroa's body was tragically pulled from the building's rubble alongside that of 26-year-old busboy, Moises Locon (pictured), who had worked at the sushi restaurant six days a week . Aftermath: Firefighters continue to hose down the site of the fire that gutted three buildings on March 27 . The gas was apparently being siphoned from the restaurant to tenants in the building. Investigators suspect the illegal hookup was switched before Con Ed inspectors visited the building on March 26, and after they left, it was put back, the Post reported. It added that authorities have not yet decided whether to use the plumber's statement against him or if they will get him to testify in exchange for a deal. Neither the landlord, Maria Hrynenko, nor her 29-year-old son Michael, who also goes by the name 'Mischou', responded to the paper's requests for comment. On Monday, it was claimed that a plumber who worked on the building has accused the landlord's son, Michael Hrynenko Jr (pictured), of making him illegally tap a gas line ahead of the deadly blast . Property records show he lives in Sparkhill in Rockland County, New York after moving from 7th Street in the East Village last year, where he lived in an apartment owned by his family. The investigation continues as authorities continue to pick through the rubble at the site. But charges including second-degree manslaughter and reckless endangerment could be brought against anyone believed to have been behind the blast, the Post reported. In August, utility workers found that the gas line had been illegally tapped, Con Ed said. The discovery led the company to shut down gas service to the building for about 10 days while the building owner made repairs. Gas service was restored after the utility deemed it safe. Inspectors from Con Ed visited that building about an hour before the explosion and determined work to upgrade gas service didn't pass inspection, locking the line to ensure it wouldn't be used. The work underway was to put in a bigger line to serve the entire building, according to Con Ed. But 15 minutes after the workers left, the smell of gas was reported. No one called 911 or Con Ed. Instead, Michael Hrynenko and a contractor, Dilber Kukic,\u00a0opened the basement door to check on where the smell was coming from. When they did so, a massive explosion shot through the building, forcing rubble onto the street and sparking a fire that spread to neighboring buildings. Both Michael Hrynenko and the contractor escaped the scene, but officials later pulled the bodies of Mr Figueroa and Mr Locon, who worked at the restaurant six days a week, from the rubble. The contractor, Dilber Kukic - who is facing unrelated charges of bribing an undercover investigator posing as a housing inspector - declined through his lawyer to comment on the explosion.",

        "input": "Albert Park - Australian Grand Prix . Sepang - Malaysian Grand Prix . Shanghai arrived with a bang in Formula One and while races in recent seasons haven't quite had the same excitement seen during its early years, there is enough substance for it to be an intriguing watch on race day. For instance whether the Chinese Grand Prix is held as a potential title decider late on in the year (2004-2008) or as an early opener (2009-present) it can often be hit with outside variables; wet conditions often sprinkling some unpredictability over a weekend. The track layout is also a challenging design. Herman Tilke ensures he gets his long straight and hairpin turn in, but it flows like Malaysia and offers great reward for getting the line through the sequence of fast turns spot on, in the middle of the lap especially. A decent run out on to the back straight is a catalyst for the classic trademark move going into the penultimate corner. Even the pit lanes can be challenging (you'll see if you scroll down) which brings us nicely on to the latest in\u00a0Sportsmail's series of Grand Prix memories... The Shanghai circuit held the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix in 2004 and has been home to the event ever since. Here is a picture shortly before its first race, with the grandstand and pit straight seen towards the back. It sure seems a long walk from the huge car park... Ricardo Zonta featured late on in the 2004 season, and is pictured in his Toyota during qualifying with the main grandstand in the background. The Brazilian had replaced the sacked Cristiano da Matta but this would be his penultimate race start in Formula One . Having been dropped by BAR for 2004, there was plenty of attention on Jacques Villeneuve when he returned to the F1 grid for the Chinese Grand Prix. In his traditional baggy overalls, the 1997 world champion poses with team boss Flavio Briatore having joined Renault for the final three races of the season following the team's dismissal of Jarno Trulli . The cameras are all on Villenueve as he emerges from the garage for his first Renault run, but the gamble to hire the Canadian backfired as he failed to score a single point for the team who would lose out to BAR in the fight for second in the constructors' championship . What's up, Fernando?! Jaguar's Mark Webber, Toyota's Olivier Panis and BAR's Takuma Sato all take a moment to wave to the Shanghai crowd in 2004, but Alonso looks far from amused with his shades on and a glum looking face to match . Given the dominance of Ferrari at the time, very few would have guessed that Rubens Barrichello's 2004 win would be his last for the team. At least he looks like he is making the most of it as he celebrates with Kimi Raikkonen, with the Finn finishing third behind Jenson Button . In a totally bizarre incident, Michael Schumacher steps out his wreck of a Ferrari which rests on the side of the track. The German collided with Christijan Albers' Minardi while driving out the pit-lane to the grid before the start of the 2005 race - both would compete in a spare car . It's all smiles at Renault as they celebrate clinching the constructors' title in the last race of the 2005 season ahead of McLaren. It capped off a perfect year for the team with Fernando Alonso (centre) becoming world champion and Giancarlo Fisichella (holding trophy aloft) proving a capable rear gunner as they recaptured success not seen since the team's previous incarnation as Benetton in 1995 . The 2005 race in Shanghai also proved to be the end of an era as the popular underdogs Minardi raced for the final time. Team boss Paul Stoddart proudly holds off a pit board showing their record of 340 races since 1985 alongside team staff and drivers Robert Doornbos (left) and Christijan Albers. Thankfully the team remained in the sport and survive to this day in its current guise as Toro Rosso . It wasn't just Minardi departing in 2005 as Jordan would also race for the final time before becoming Force India. But Narain Karthikeyan would only last 28 laps before an accident ended his race. Here, race winner Fernando Alonso zips past in his Renault, with the Indian driver seen in his yellow overalls observing the wreckage on the opposite side of the track . Shanghai in 2006 provided one of its most dramatic races. Fernando Alonso was in control before his decision to pit for scrubbed front intermediate tyres would come back to haunt him. The Spaniard was in a title fight with Michael Schumacher who, in the background, quickly caught the struggling Renault. Gianarclo Fisichella tries to provide a protective barrier to his team-mate, but so slow was Alonso that even the Italian had to pass him - with Schumacher soon following . Schumcaher would also go on to pass Fisichella and claim a very famous victory which saw the title race swing dramatically in the favour of the Ferrari star. The agony and ecstasy from the Renault and Ferrari drivers on the podium tells its own story with Alonso and Fisichella looking devastated and puzzled at how they lost the race . With his Ferrari team right behind him, Schumacher celebrates his unlikely win in parc ferme. The German's record in the Chinese Grand Prix was otherwise poor this race aside, but his famous 2006 victory would be his 91st and final Grand Prix victory in his career . Just when you thought 2006 couldn't be beaten, the following year's grand prix served up one of the pivotal  moments of the 2007 season. Rookie Lewis Hamilton tried to drag a set of beaten up intermediate tyres as long as he could around the circuit and did the hard bit by staying on the road. But when coming to pit in for new rubber, he somehow beached his McLaren in a gravel trap. Here the Brit reacts to a horrendous error with a marshall offering assistance. The right rear tyre shows just how little rubber was left on his tyre as he pitted . In a double blow for Hamilton, it was title rival Kimi Raikkonen who would benefit as the Ferrari star would go on to win the race and eventually the championship later on in the season by just one point. The Finn is shown a board to let him know he is starting his final lap . But Lewis would bounce back in 2008 as he sussed out the correct route to the pit-lane and in doing so found the key to grabbing victory. Here, the McLaren driver celebrates his win with his mother Carmen Lockhart and his step mother Linda Hamilton in parc ferme . Hide and seek Formula One style? No, it's just Nico Rosberg trying to push his Williams out of the tyre barrier following a crash during Saturday practice ahead of the 2009 race . Get out of the spray! As the safety car prepares to come in during 2009, Sebastian Vettel leads the pack in his Red Bull with team-mate Mark Webber, the Brawns of Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button, and the Toyota of Jarno Trulli seeking a line on the track where they are not blinded by spray on a wet afternoon in Shanghai . Spray would prove no problem for Vettel, who punches the air with delight after securing Red Bull's first ever win in 2009 much to the joy of team members on the pit wall. The race was the first year in which the grand prix was hosted earlier in the season where it remains . Sebastien Buemi suffered a terrifying crash just shy of 200mph during the first practice session ahead of the 2010 event, as flying down the long back straight both of his front wheels simultaneously broke off leaving him without any steering and just rear brakes to stop. Thankfully a large run off area and a gravel trap left him enough room to significantly reduce his speed before he slid along a barrier coming to a safe stop . Two fantastic drivers of their respective generations duel at the hairpin on the back straight, but sadly the best of Michael Schumacher (left) had long since passed as McLaren's Lewis Hamilton prepares to drive round the outside of the Mercedes star in 2010 . But it was Hamilton's team-mate Jenson Button who would claim 2010 victory - with the duo exchanging a warm hand-shake on the podium . Hamilton was shaking more hands a year later but this time it was as the grand prix winner, as Red Bull's Mark Webber, who finished third, greets the McLaren driver in parc ferme after the race. The triumph made Hamilton the first multi-time winner at Shanghai . Nico Rosberg leads the pack out of the first twisty opening section in front of Mercedes team-mate Michael Schumacher as McLaren's Jenson Button follows in third. Rosberg would go on to win the 2012 race which would be his first in his Formula One career . Mercedes team members rush to the pit-wall to greet Rosberg on his victory, which was the first for the team since 1955. Mercedes had only re-entered F1 as a team again in 2010 after taking over from the one-season wonders Brawn - who had previously been Honda . Fernando Alonso leads the celebrations as he holds a Ferrari flag in front of his delighted team following his 2013 win. The Spaniard looked like he could lead a Ferrari title fight following this victory, but he has only won one grand prix since. Can you name where and when it was? (Answer is at the bottom of the page) The story of 2014? The trophies piled up for Mercedes last year and the Shanghai result reflected the story of the championship as Lewis Hamilton kept Nico Rosberg at arm's length to lead home a one-two triumph for the team in the Chinese Grand Prix . 2004: Rubens Barrichello (Ferrari) 2005: Fernando Alonso (Renault) 2006: Michael Schumacher (Ferrari) 2007: Kimi Raikkonen (Ferrari) 2008: Lewis Hamilton (McLaren) 2009: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) 2010: Jenson Button (McLaren) 2011: Lewis Hamilton (McLaren) 2012: Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) 2013: Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) 2014: Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) Bold indicates driver still active on Formula One grid .

Sitting on a bank balance that could sustain a small country, means that the cost of flights and accommodation has never been an issue for the reality TV star. So, where to go and what to do? While the famous Kardashian used to pick holidays close to home, in the sun, on a beach and with her family - if her  recent vacations are anything to go by - times have  changed. Scroll down for video . Kim  has long had her pick of holiday destinations - so how have her holiday tastes changed over the years? This month, Kim and her husband Kanye West made a high-profile tour of Armenia and Israel to baptise their daughter and retrace the Kardashian roots. Paris is top of her travel-list and she has spent increasing amounts of time in the French capital with her husband. Kim has also been ditching sun loungers for salopettes and skis on stylish winter breaks. It seems that as her fame has rocketed, Kim's travel tastes have likewise changed.

        "input": "There are some very high expectations for the JJ Abrams-directed\u00a0Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens when it hits theaters on December 18. The space epic is already being predicted to rake in a global $500m on its opening weekend, according to a Tuesday article from The Hollywood Reporter. That's more than the $483m record set by the final Harry Potter film -\u00a0Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 - in 2011. Scroll down for trailer . The film could make over $2 billion: Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens  released its trailer on Thursday to a packed audience at California's Anaheim Convention Center; here Harrison Ford appears as Han Solo alongside Chewbacca . 'If it pleases the fans of the old movies and also appeals to kids, watch out,' box-office analyst Phil Contrino told the publication. 'Force Awakens will hit $1 billion without blinking. If it's really good, it could cross $2 billion.' Already\u00a0Disney and Lucasfilm are working overtime to drum up interest in the scifi extravaganzat that's full of Stormtroopers, Jedis and lightsabers. Ancient: The opening shot of the trailer reveals a speeder on the planet Jaku, where a crashed Star Destoyer and X-Wing are buried in the sand . The second trailer was released on Thursday to massive fanfare at the Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim. The one minute 51 second trailer was unveiled by Abrams with stars Fisher, Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac and John Boyega looking on. The clip is the first time Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford, has been seen on film since 1983's Return of The Jedi. He is joined by Chewbacca at the end of the trailer and heard saying, 'Chewie, we're home.' Burned: An unknown pair of hands hold the melted mask of Darth Vader, apparently retrieved from his funeral pyre at the end of Return Of The Jedi . Familiar? A hooded unknown character with a robotic arm, possibly Luke Skywalker, is seen reaching for R2D2 . Passing it down? We see a lightsaber - which looks exacly like Luke's from A New Hope - being handed over, strongly suggesting Skywalker has had a child . Fly boys: An X-Wing squadron is seen racing along above water . Red leader: Oscar Isaac whoops as X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron, still bearing the rebel insignia on his helmet . Amboee Brand Intelligence is reporting a global debut of $533.2 million to $539.5 million. They're basing their prediction on how well the Star Wars trailer is trafficking online. And they are impressed by how it has done much better than the trailers for both Furious 7 and Fifty Shades Of Grey, which have been massive international hits. In trouble: Daisy Ridley plays Rey and John Boyega is Finn - they are seen fleeing a pursuing TIE Fighter on the Jaku . New baddie: The mysterious wielder of the much-discussed crucifix lightsaber is revealed, using the Force while wearing a mask . It is already being assumed that Force Awakens will get the widest release ever, meaning at least 4,500 locations in North America. The Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart vampire saga Twilight: Eclipse went out in 4,468 screens. Disney did not comment to the Reporter. And the competition won't be stiff either. The other films coming out that weekend are Sisters, Universal's Tina Fey-Amy Poehler comedy. New Empire: The new Stormtroopers form ranks in front of a new insignia that is reminiscent of the old Imperial one . New look: Modern TIE fighters are seen flying in formation above the desert planet, possibly in pursuit of Finn and Rey . The trailer opens on what appears to be the newly revealed desert planet Jaku (or Jakoo), as a speeder races across the sands we see an ancient downed Star Destroyer and a skeletal X-Wing, which clearly crashed there from orbit decades ago. We then see a an unknown pair of hands holding the mangled mask of Darth Vader, melted and disfigured from the Sith lord's funeral pyre at the end of Return of the Jedi. We hear a voice - believed to be Mark Hamill's - reprising a line from the 1983 film: 'The force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it. My sister has it.' Ambush: A base filled with Stormtroopers and TIE fighters comes under attack from unseen assailants . Revealed: Fans already knew Boyega's character was a Stormtrooper - or at least posed as one - since November's first teaser trailer . A hooded figure with a robotic arm, very likely Luke Skywalker, reaches out and lays a hand on R2D2 as John Williams rising score plays in the background. We then see a lightsaber changing hands between two more unseen characters, as the voice finishes: 'You have that power too' - a strong suggestion Luke Skywalker has had a child. The lightsaber itself looks exactly like the one Luke inherited from Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope, but lost when Darth Vader cut off his hand above at the climax of The Empire Strikes Back, suggesting the weapon was somehow retrieved from below Bespin's Cloud City. Upgrades: A number of ships from the old Imperial fleet are seen, including this Star Destroyer . Elite: One of the most intriguing images from the trailer was this unknown troop, wearing a black version of the Stormtrooper armour . Then in a flurry of quick scenes we see Oscar Isaac as pilot Poe Dameron flying with a squadron of X-Wings above water; His helmet and flight suit still bear the Rebel insignia from the original series. Suddenly a hooded figure swinging the much-discussed 'crucifix lightsaber' at the camera; before John Boyega and Daisy Ridley as Rey and Finn are seen fleeing a TIE fighter blasting at them from above the desert planet, while the new rolling droid BB8 trudles speedily beside them. Passenger: The rolling droid BB-8 is spotted inside the Millennium Falcon, peeking around a corner . She gets into more than she bargained for: Rey gets involved with Finn and also crosses paths with Isaac's character, it was learned . It is then we get our first proper look at the masked villain wielding the red lightsaber as he performs a Force push, while Stormtroopers mill about him in amid a fiery background. We then appear to get a glimpse of what has become of the Empire - a squadron on the new look Stormtroopers form rank in a snow-covered location beneath a new black and red insignia reminiscent of the old Imperial one, surrounded by gun batteries and parked TIE fighters, while a sole figue can be seen on a stage way in the background. Immediately we get to see the new look TIE fighters in action as a pair fly in formation above the sand, before a base filled with the former Imperial troops and falls under attack. Helping hand: This appears to be the moment Finn and Rey meet - as both actors confirmed in the Q&A they become allies in the film . Bucket of bolts: Fans got to see the Millennium Falcon in action once again, as it is pursued by two TIE Fighters . Executor? The ship is chased into the inverted ruins of a Super Star Destroyer, which also appears to have crashed on the desert planet . One of the TIE fighters seems to attack its own base, suggesting it was commandeered by whomever the troops are fighting against. As the explosions rock the base we see one Stormtrooper remove his helmet to reveal John Boyega, a plot point fans were aware of having spotted him in the uniform in the fist teaser trailer back in November. As the trailer continues, more and more evidence of surviving elements of the supposedly toppled Empire are revealed, including at least one operating Star Destroyer, although all the ships seen appear to have been modified or updated in the decades that have past since Return Of The Jedi. I have you now: The TIE fighter pilot fires upon the Millennium Falcon as it chases the ship that once belonged to Han Solo . Homage: This shot is a clear nod the pursuit of the Falcon through the second Death Star at the climax of 1983's Return Of The Jedi . One of the most intriguing shots was of a new character wearing a black version of Stormtrooper armour, perhaps some sort of elite troop, who wore a cloak over one\u00a0shoulder\u00a0similar to fan favourite Boba Fett. This image is followed by one of BB-8 peeking around a corner in thr interior of a ship that is surely the\u00a0Millennium\u00a0Falcon. During the Q&A session at the fan panel in Anaheim, John and Daisy had confirmed that their characters form an allegiance and the trailer appears to show that moment as Rey stand's above an exhausted Finn - presumably after fleeing from the Tie fighters - and extends an arm in friendship. In character: The actors in costume for the adventure; Daisy wore the same style of togs Mark Hamill wore as Luke in the first Star Wars . A new look: Several scenes from The Force Awakens were shared; this one shows Boyega in his Stormtrooper outfit . The penultimate shot of the trailer shows the Millennium Falcon - whose pilot is as yet unknown - being pursued across Jaku by a pair of TIE fighters, presumably the same ones that were chasing Finn and Rey. They chase the ship, once (and possibly still) owned by Han Solo into the belly of an enormous ruined inverted Super Star Destroyer. In one of the teasers many nods to the original films besides, the sequence mirrors the final battle above Endor when the Falcon was flown into the heart of the second Death Star. During the panel, JJ talked about his love of the franchise. 'I was 11 years old when Star Wars come out,' he said. 'That moment transported me. It was the first time a movie made me laugh that way.... the film was brilliant and had such heart and the biggest thing for me was that it had such hope. 'Shooting in Abu Dhabi was an incredible thing. Shooting Star Wars is a Western and a fairy tale... shooting in Abu Dhabi was just that,' he added. They were generous with their photos: JJ is seen here giving direction to Daisy who was atop a platform . Everyone loves a good creature: The audience cheered when JJ flashed this image where he is working with Chewbacca on set . He is still rolling along: Abrams (left) and Kennedy (right) with the tech guys who make R2D2 work . A lot of work goes into making a good droid: One of the 'tinkerers' that had a hand in making the units for the December movie . Walking tall: Also shared was a full-length shot of Oscar in his flight gear that included the standard orange suit . Committed to his move: Abrams explained he liked shooting Episode VII in Abu Dhabi, which subs not for Tatooine but rather another new planet . This robot already has a fan base: BB-8 appeared in the first trailer in November and was an instant hit . A very good pilot: Isaac, seen in his aircraft, said he is sent on a mission by a princess .",
