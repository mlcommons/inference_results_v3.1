class ArgDiscarder:
    """Mitten TensorRTBuilder Ops were designed to be used as Python Mixins, which must claim arguments and forward
    unused ones to super. However, the old API passed around large dicts of config arguments, which contained extraneous
    information (i.e. GenerateEngines would also be given harness run arguments, which would be unused).
    When used with mixins, extraneous arguments will throw an error if object.__init__ is called with unexpected
    arguments.

    This class is a mixin which stops the forwarding of *args and **kwargs.

    DeprecationWarning: Will be removed when the codebase is fully refactored.
