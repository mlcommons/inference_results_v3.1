Converts a sample partition .txt file from MLPerf Inference reference to .npy

To generate the .txt file, clone the MLPerf Inference reference repo, and follow the instructions to generate the
partition trace file. You can remove a lot of the imports and comment a lot of their code, or simply extract that
snippet of code if you do not want to run the reference model.
