The sparsified bert submissions done by CTuning is using the [MLCommons reference implementations](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm-mlops/script/app-mlperf-inference-reference) for deepsparse backend made by NeuralMagic.

Please follow [this script](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/cm-mlops/script/run-all-mlperf-models/run-pruned-bert.sh) for generating an end to end submission for the sparsified bert models.
